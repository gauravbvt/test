Nerkel debugging in Eclipse
---------------------------

1. Don't put NK's lib/endorsed/*.jar libraries into jre/lib/endorsed as suggested. It breaks Eclipse.

2. Create a Java project to hold NetKernel-specific configuration

  - Let's call it NetKernel
  - Add the required libraries to the build path (in project properties), preferrably using variables:
    - 1060netkernel-bootloader-*.*.*.jar (from <nk>/lib)
    - 1060NetKernel-*.*.*.jar (from <nk>/lib)
    - ext-layer1.*.*.*.jar (from <nk>/modules)
    - db.jar and dbxml.jar (from <dbxml>/install/lib)

3. Export them all from the build path of the NetKernel application

4. Create a run configuration for the NetKernel application

    - Within 1060netkernel-bootloader-*.*.*.jar select BootLoader.class
    - Right-click and select "Run as/Run..."
    - Create a new Java Application run configuration on BootLoader.class
    - Set VM arguments to:
        -Xms128m 
        -Xmx192m
        -Dbootloader.basepath=${netkernel_home}    
        -Djava.endorsed.dirs=${netkernel_home}/lib/endorsed    
        -Dbootloader.jarDir=${netkernel_home}/lib/ext/
        -Djava.library.path=${dbxml_home}/install/lib
        -Dbootloader.nativeDir=${netkernel_home}/lib/native
     -Set VM arguments variables to: 
        netkernel_home=<netkernel installation directory>
        dbxml_home=<dbxml installation directory>
     -Apply and run to test

5. Create another Java Application Project for Channels NK development

  - Since we already have an SVN project called channels-nk, we'll name this one channels-java
  - In project properties/Java Build Path/Projects, import the NetKernel project
  - For each Channels module under development:
    - Put into the project folder a link to each source folder containing com/mindalliance/channels/...
    - In project properties/Java Build Path/Source, add the folder
    - Allow output folders to source folders (checkbox)

6. Set breakpoints in NK module Java code and do Run/Run... or Run/Debug..., selecting the Bootloader run configuration.
