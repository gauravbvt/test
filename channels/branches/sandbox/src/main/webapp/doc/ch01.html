            inter-dependent world. Systemic risks are growing. Organizations must
            network to compete in a global marketplace. They can no longer respond to
            major crisis nor can they seize global business opportunities on their
            own. Success now largely depends on the timely and targeted sharing of
            information within and between organizations.
        </p><p>During a crisis, information will not spontaneously flow as needed.
            Maintaining contact lists is not enough; organizations must plan ahead and
            create actionable information sharing procedures.
        </p><p>Information Sharing Planning provides a framework and method for
            designing and improving the information sharing procedures required to
            successfully manage systemic risks and seize opportunities.

                <span class="emphasis"><em>Information Sharing Planning captures, analyzes and
                    deploys knowledge of how organizations need to share information to
                    mitigate systemic risks and seize opportunities from anticipated
                    events.

            </p><p>Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces information sharing
                procedures for event preparedness, response and recovery. Information
                Sharing Plans capture commitments to share the information required for
                organizations to fulfill their missions.
            </p><p>ISP uncovers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>who needs what information, and why and when,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>who has or can produce needed information, and how and

                    </p></li></ul></div><p>It is important understand that an Information Sharing Plan is not
                an action plan. Its objective is not to dictate a sequence of actions.
                Information sharing planning concerns itself exclusively with capturing
                the information sharing required according to circumstance so that
                necessary tasks can be carried out successfully.
            </p><p>However, task sequencing is not entirely absent from ISP. A task
                may require information produced by another task that would then
                necessarily precede it. These sequencing constraints do not typically
                apply to all tasks and they certainly do not dictate a unique ordering
                for all tasks. In any case, attempting to define an action plan for
                organizations that don't have a central authority is more often than not
                an exercise in futility. What really matters here is capturing what
                needs to be done, what information is required and produced, and how and
                when it should or should not be shared.
