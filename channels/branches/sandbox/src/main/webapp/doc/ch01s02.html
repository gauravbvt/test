                <em class="glossterm">Information Sharing Plan</em>
                captures the
                information sharing procedures that people and systems in roles of
                responsibility are expected to apply in order to fulfill the missions of
                their organizations before, during and/or after certain types of events.
                A Plan is comprised of tasks and information flows. Tasks manage risks,
                achieve gains and/or contribute information to other tasks. Information
                flows connect tasks that produce information with tasks that require
                it.
            </p><p>An Information Sharing Plan can be abstracted from a specific
                context (a context is a collection of organizations with people and
                systems in their employ) so as to make the Plan generally
                applicable.
            </p><p>An
                <em class="glossterm">event</em>
                in ISP is something that happens
                or has happened somewhere and that introduces risks to organizations or
                to their missions.
            </p><p>A
                <em class="glossterm">goal</em>
                is either a risk or a gain. A goal
                is associated with the pre-, co- or post- event phase of an anticipated
                event. A
                <em class="glossterm">risk</em>
                is a possible, negative outcome and
                it is categorized according to an actuarial taxonomy of risks, and it is
                rated as more or less severe. A
                <em class="glossterm">gain</em>
                is the flip
                side of a risk. It is a possible positive outcome, and it is categorized
                by a taxonomy that mirrors the risk taxonomy. A gain is rated as either
                low, medium or high.
            </p><p>A goal is either a risk or a gain. A goal is associated with the
                pre-, co- or post- event phase of an anticipated event. A risk is a
                possible, negative outcome and it is categorized according to an
                actuarial taxonomy of risks, and it is rated as more or less severe. A
                gain is the flip side of a risk. It is a possible positive outcome, and
                it is categorized by a taxonomy that mirrors the risk taxonomy. A gain
                is rated as either low, medium or high.
            </p><p>Information sharing plans will typically deal with more than one
                phase of more that one type of event. Because plans can become quite
                large, planners break them into smaller, more manageable units of
                planning called segments.
            </p><p>An information sharing
                <em class="glossterm">segment</em>
                covers one
                phase of one type of event, and it will typically focus on just a few
                goals of organizations. Segments usually depend on other segments. Two
                segments are co-dependent when information produced by a task in one
                segment is consumed by a task in the other, or when a task in one
                segment initiates the event phase covered by the other segment.
            </p><p>Segments are planning artifacts. They are not meaningful to
                non-planners. An information sharing playbook ignores segment boundaries
                when aggregating a person or system's task assignments and sharing
                commitments.
            </p><p>A
                <em class="glossterm">task</em>
                in ISP describes something done
                somewhere for some purpose by a person or system in a role of
                responsibility on behalf of an organization. The people or systems
                carrying out tasks are profiled by name, role, jurisdiction and/or
                organization. The executor of a task may be profiled only partially so
                that more than one person or system match the profile and get assigned
                to the task. According to a tasks' definition, those assigned to the
                task are expected to carry it out either as a team or on their
                own.
            </p><p>Tasks are considered useful if they:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>achieve risk mitigation or gains,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>initiate or terminate (phases of) events,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>or produce information needed by other useful tasks.</p></li></ul></div><p>Tasks can be triggered or terminated by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>awareness of events,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>notifications they receive,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>requests for information they receive.</p></li></ul></div><p>
                <em class="glossterm">Information flows</em>
                link tasks that produce
                information to tasks that consume it. A flow is characterized by:
            </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>the information communicated (down to its elements, each with
                        optional secrecy classifications and optional sourcing and handling

                <em class="glossterm">Task assignments</em>
                are determined by matching
                the tasks specified in the Plan with the people and systems profiled in
                a context. People and systems are bound by
                <em class="glossterm">information
                    sharing commitments
                </em>
                when they are assigned tasks that
                produce information consumed by other tasks.
            </p><p>The
                <em class="glossterm">information sharing procedures</em>
                captured
                by a Plan are the task assignments plus the information sharing
                commitments of all persons and systems in context.
            </p><p>An
                <em class="glossterm">information sharing playbook</em>
                is the sum
                of all information sharing procedures in a Plan for a given person or
                system.
            </p><p>Plans, segments, tasks, information needs, capabilities and flows
                are defined in terms of actual or types of agents, places, roles,
                organizations, events, communication media and phases of events. These
                are called entities. An entity in ISP is grab-all concept for something
                not planned that can be unambiguously referenced by name. Entities may
                themselves be defined in terms of other entities (an organization
                assigns roles to the persons it employs and systems it administers,
                etc.).
            </p><p>Actual entities (&#8220;Jane Smith&#8221;, &#8220;ACME Inc.&#8221;, &#8220;Morristown, Morris
                County, NJ, USA&#8221; etc.) are categorized by types of entities (&#8220;Senior
                executive&#8221;, &#8220;Corporation&#8221;, &#8220;City&#8221; etc.). Entity types can refine other
                entity types (a &#8220;Senior executive&#8221; is an &#8220;Executive&#8221;).
            </p><p>An
                <em class="glossterm">agent</em>
                is either a person or an
                information processing system (system for short). A system is capable of
                sending notifications, answering queries, receiving notifications or
                sending queries. An agent has contact information. An agent's clearance
                is a list of secrecy classifications. A secrecy classification has a
                name (&#8220;NATO&#8221;) and an ordered list of secrecy levels (&#8220;Restricted&#8221;,
                &#8220;Confidential&#8221;, &#8220;Secret&#8221;, &#8220;Focal Top Secret&#8221;, &#8220;Cosmic Top
                Secret&#8221;).
            </p><p>An
                <em class="glossterm">organization</em>
                is a group of agents
                organized to accomplish a mission. An organization assigns roles of
                responsibility to the persons and systems that act on its behalf. An
                organization has contact information and may contain other
                organizations. An organization may have information sharing agreements
                with other organizations to formalize the sharing commitments its
                members has with members of other organizations.
            </p><p>A
                <em class="glossterm">role</em>
                is a set of powers and
                responsibilities assigned by an organization to an agent acting on
                behalf of the organization. A role assignment may be restricted to a
                jurisdiction.
            </p><p>A
                <em class="glossterm">place</em>
                is either a geographical area (some
                city, county, state, country, natural preserve etc.) or a known location
                (some train station, building etc.). A place can be contained in another
                (for example, a building can be in a campus). An event and an event type
                can both be scoped to a place.
            </p><p>A
                <em class="glossterm">phase</em>
                names a time period relative to an
                event. A phase of an event is either CONFIDENTIAL - Copyright (C) 2010
                Mind-Alliance Systems. All Rights Reserved. 8 set to before, during or
                after the event. Typical phases are &#8220;Preparing&#8221;, &#8220;Responding&#8221; and
                &#8220;Recovering&#8221;.
            </p><p>A
                <em class="glossterm">communication medium</em>
                is how agents
                transmit information. A medium is either unicast (transmits to a single,
                known agent), multicast (transmits to multiple, known agents) or
                broadcast (little to no control over who receives the transmission).
                Communication media may or may not be technology-based. &#8220;Telephone&#8221;,
                &#8220;Email&#8221;, &#8220;Instant Messaging&#8221; are examples of unicast communication
                media, and so is &#8220;Face-to-face&#8221;. &#8220;Notification system&#8221; and &#8220;Meeting&#8221; are
                both multicast media. &#8220;Television&#8221;, &#8220;Radio&#8221; and &#8220;PA System&#8221; are examples
                of broadcast media. A communication medium can delegate transmissions to
                other media (for example, VoIP can interface with Telephones). The
                security of a medium is expressed in terms of secrecy
                classifications.
            </p><p>ISP identifies more than 60 different kinds of
                <em class="glossterm">issues</em>
                about tasks, information flows, entities
                and entire segments and plans. There are issues of validity (definition
                errors), completeness (missing Plan elements) and robustness (something
                that makes the Plan failure-prone). An issue has a description, a list
                of suggested remediations, and a severity level.
