                or communication medium) is automatically created whenever it is first
                referenced by name. Channels requires that all entities of a given
                kind be assigned unique names (John Smith, John Smith (1), John Smith
                (2) etc.).
            </p><p>Recall that the definitions of Plan elements can reference
                actual entities (ACME Corporation, Peter Sanchez, Morristown NJ) and
                types of entities (a corporation, a certified emergency technician, a
                city). An entity can only be tagged with entity types of its own kind
                (Warehouse A can be tagged as a building but not as a senior
                executive). Both actual entities and entity types can be edited. An
                editable and analytical view of an actual entity or type of entity can
                be opened from wherever it is referenced.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_8.png"></div></div><p>Keep in mind that events, roles and communication media in a
                Plan are always types. There is no actual event in a Plan because
                events are always anticipated. There is no such thing as an &#8220;actual
                role&#8221; because roles are always concepts. Communication media are also
                always types because a Plan only cares about the class of a
                communication medium.
            </p><p>The
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Details view</em></span>
                of an entity enables a
                planner to change the entity's name, description, and types.
            </p><p>Each kind of entity has additional, specific attributes that can
                also be set. For example, a planner editing an actual organization can
                define its mission, and set its location, contact information, and
                parent organization. A planner can enforce that any sharing commitment
                by the organization with another be covered by an agreement, and that
                there be at least one known agent for each referenced role assigned by
                the organization. A planner edits the organization's employment roster
                of agents by either confirming employment implied by task in segments
                and assigning titles. A planner can also directly add new employees
                with their titles, roles and jurisdictions.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_9.png"></div></div><p>Cross-organizational sharing commitments are inferred from
                information flows in the Plan. A sharing agreement may or may not
                exist for a sharing commitment that crosses organizational boundaries.
                An unconfirmed agreement for a cross-organizational sharing commitment
                is an issue if such agreements are required for the organization. When
                viewing an organization, a planner can see the sharing commitments the
                organization makes with other organizations and confirm whether each
                commitment is covered or not by an agreement.
            </p><p>In the Details view of any kind of entity, references to the
                entity are listed as a filterable and paged index. Issues about the
                entity, if any, are enumerated at the bottom of the view.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_10.png"></div></div><p>In the Details view of an actual agent (as opposed to a type of
                agent), the agent, if it is a person and not a system, can be related
                to a user. The user, if not a planner, will be able to request to view
                his or her playbook (the agent's playbook) from the production version
                of the Plan. The agent can be declared to be a person or system, and
                given contact information (communication media with addresses where
                applicable) as well as clearances (secrecy classifications).
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_68.png"></div></div><p>When editing a place from within the Details view, a planner can
                identify what other place, if any, contains it. A planner can also
                give the place a street address, postal code and a geoname. If the
                geoname is ambiguous, more specific geonames are offered for
                selection.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_55.png"></div></div><p>When editing a communication medium, a planner can set the
                transmission mode to either unicast (one -to-one), multicast
                (one-to-many) or broadcast (one-to-any), unless the mode is already
                implied by another medium this one is tagged with (to make it a
                special case of the tagging medium). The address pattern is a &#8220;regular
                expression&#8221;1 that constrains the form an &#8220;address&#8221; can take for this
                medium. A planner can identify the media, if any, this one interfaces
                with as it carries out transmissions from sender to receiver. Here
                again, some of the interfaced media might be implied from another
                medium this one is tagged with. Finally, a planner can describe the
                security of the communication medium in terms of security
                classifications. Qualifying a medium as &#8220;US Gov/Top Secret&#8221; means that
                Top Secret information can be transmitted securely over this
                medium.

                <span class="emphasis"><em>Network view</em></span>
                is available on agents,
                roles, and organizations. It displays a network graph depicting how
                the entity is connected by information flows to other entities of the
                same kind. This analytical view allows a planner to filter the
                information flows to, say, show only the ones from tasks executed by a
                specific role. The network graph is navigable. The list of flows can
                be further filtered, sorted and paged. Listed flows can also be
                navigated to.

                <span class="emphasis"><em>Issues view</em></span>
                collects and filters issues
                that are about an entity or that are related to it. Waived issues can
                be included in or excluded from the sortable, page-able list of
                issues.
            </p><p>Surveys, whether ongoing, closed, or to-be-created, are
                accessible from each listed issue. Only planners can launch or close
                surveys. A survey gathers the opinions of planners and non-planners
                alike on how a particular issue should be remediated.
