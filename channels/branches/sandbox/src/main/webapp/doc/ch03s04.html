      edit the task specifications. Note that the fields of the form are
      disabled if someone else is currently editing the same task. The listed
      &#8220;sends&#8221; of the task (information shared by the task plus its information
      capabilities) and &#8220;receives&#8221; (information shared with the task plus its
      information needs) can also be edited by clicking on the summaries to
      open up their respective forms.</p><p>Note that, as a rule, none of the fields of a form anywhere in
      Channels need to be given a value. Any field can be left blank.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_3.png"></div></div><div class="section" title="Editing a task"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1600"></a>Editing a task</h3></div></div></div><p>A task is specified first by naming it and then by categorizing
        it. It is further specified by stating where it is to be executed, by
        whom, in what role, for what jurisdiction, and on behalf of what
        organization. Any of the location, agent, jurisdiction, role, and
        organization (entities) that specify a task can be left unnamed so as
        to imply that more than one agent can be assigned to the task. The
        names of entities can refer to actual entities (Morritown, NJ, John
        Doe, ACME etc.) or to types of entities (a city, a certified
        technician, a corporation etc.).</p><p>The execution of a task can be set to be &#8220;as a team&#8221; to indicate
        that all assignees are to work together when carrying out the task. By
        default, assignees are each to execute the task independently.</p><p>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to
        complete, whether it repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts
        automatically with the segment (implying that the assigned agents
        would become aware of the onset of the event phase on their
        own).</p><p>The purpose of a task can be stated as terminating the event
        phase of the segment, mitigating one or more risks or achieve gains
        within the segment's scope.</p><p>Related reference and policy documents can be attached to the
        task either by URL or by uploading them. Finally, the task can be
        given a brief, informal description.</p><p>As with any Plan elements, a planner can add issues to those
        automatically detected about the task. Issues added by a planner can
        be removed by any planner.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_3a.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Editing a &#34;send&#34; or &#34;receive&#34;"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1622"></a>Editing a "send" or "receive"</h3></div></div></div><p>The information needed, produced or to be shared is named, its
        intent is identified and its elements are enumerated.</p><p>The mode of communication is given as either notification or
        by-request (push or pull).</p><p>If an information flow (information that's shared) is a
        notification, then it can be made a broadcast (information will be
        shared with all agents assigned to the target task) or a unicast
        (information will be shared with at least one agent assigned to the
        target task).</p><p>Keep in mind that an information flow that is a &#8220;send&#8221; to a task
        producing shared information is the same information flow that is a
        &#8221;receive&#8221; to the task consuming the shared information. One is looking
        at one flow from its two ends.</p><p>An information flow is created by first adding an information
        need to a task (if necessary), then adding an information capability
        of the same name in another (also if necessary), and then connecting
        the need to the capability or vice-versa by setting the &#8220;from&#8221; or &#8220;to&#8221;
        field to the other task.</p><p>A communication delay is set either to zero (communication is to
        happen without delay) or to some finite time interval. For an
        information need, the delay represents the timeliness requirement for
        being notified or for getting a response to a request. For an
        information capability, the delay represents how quickly the
        information could be produced and communicated. For a sharing flow,
        the delay represents a &#8220;quality of service&#8221; commitment.</p><p>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
        can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
        information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
        is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
        that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
        listed in order of preference.</p><p>When editing a &#8220;send&#8221; or &#8220;receive&#8221;, a planner can set whether
        sharing would normally trigger or terminate a task. A notification
        could trigger or terminate the receiving task. It could also terminate
        the sending task, if sending the notification concludes the task that
        produced the information. A request could trigger the task that
        produces the requested response.</p><p>Planners can attach documents to a &#8220;send&#8221; or &#8220;receive&#8221;. A
        document can be a reference (it documents), a mandating policy (it
        obligates sharing), a prohibiting policy (it prohibits sharing), a
        multiple policy (contains language that imposes obligations and
        restrictions) or it can be an image provided as an illustration (for
        example, a screenshot). If an information flow has a prohibiting
        policy attached to it then there can not be any implied sharing
        commitment.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_3b.png"></div></div><p>An element of information can be assigned individual secrecy
        classifications and optional sourcing and handling
        instructions.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_57.png"></div></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s03.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s05.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Plan editor panels&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Segment scoping</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
