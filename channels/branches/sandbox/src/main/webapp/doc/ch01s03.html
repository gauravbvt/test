        Plan</em></a> captures the information sharing
        procedures that people and systems (agents) in roles of responsibility
        are expected to apply, within their jurisdictions, in order to fulfill
        the missions of their organizations before, during and/or after events
        of significance.</p><p>Tasks manage risks, achieve gains and/or produce information
        needed by other tasks. Information flows connect tasks that produce
        information with tasks that consume it. Shared information is
        communicated over transmission media or face to face. Sharing can be
        subject to policies.</p><p>A task specifies, in more or less generic terms, which agents
        should be assigned to it, individually or as teams. Information
        sharing procedures are generated by matching agents within the scope
        of the Plan to the tasks. Agents are bound by <em class="glossterm">information
        sharing commitments</em> whenever they are assigned to tasks
        that are connected by flows to other tasks. These agents commit to
        share the information they produce with all agents who execute the
        connected-to tasks that consume it. An implied but important
        constraint is that information can only be used to execute tasks for
        which it is explicitly shared.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/ISP_metamodel.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Plan segments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e102"></a>Plan segments</h3></div></div></div><p>Information sharing plans typically deal with more than one
        phase of more that one anticipated event, and they can involve a large
        number of organizations. Because plans can become quite large,
        planners break them into smaller, more manageable units of planning
        called segments.</p><p>An information sharing <em class="glossterm">segment</em> covers
        only one phase of one event and addresses some of the related
        organizational goals. A segment will typically focus on just a few
        goals. Segments usually depend on other segments. Two segments are
        co-dependent when information produced by a task in one segment is
        consumed by a task in the other, or when a task in one segment
        initiates the event phase covered by the other segment.</p></div><div class="section" title="Tasks and flows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e112"></a>Tasks and flows</h3></div></div></div><p>A task describes an action carried out at some location and for
        some purpose by one or more agents. Agents act to fulfill the
        responsibilities of roles bestowed on them by organizations. The
        agents expected to carry out a task can be identified by any
        combination of name, role, jurisdiction and organization. The executor
        of a task may be identified only partially (for example, by role and
        organization only) so that more than one person or system will match
        the profile and get assigned to the task. According to a tasks'
        definition, those assigned to the task are expected to carry it out
        either as a team or on their own.</p><p>Tasks are considered useful if they:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>directly achieve risk mitigation or gains,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>initiate or terminate (phases of) events,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>or produce information needed by other useful tasks.</p></li></ul></div><p>Tasks can be triggered or terminated by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>awareness of events,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>notifications they receive,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>requests for information they receive.</p></li></ul></div><p><em class="glossterm">Information flows</em> link tasks that produce
        information to tasks that consume it. A flow is characterized
        by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>the information communicated (down to its elements, each
            with optional secrecy classifications and optional sourcing and
            handling instructions),</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the intent of the flow (alarm, announcement, command,
            feedback or report)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the mode of communication (request vs notification, unicast
            vs multicast vs broadcast),</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a list of preferred transmission media (phone, face-to-face
            etc.),</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the impacts, if any, the communication may have (it might
            trigger or terminate a task),</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>instructions on how to carryout the task,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>policies that mandate or prohibit sharing.</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Entities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e167"></a>Entities</h3></div></div></div><p>Plans, segments, tasks, information needs, capabilities and
        sharing flows are defined in terms of agents, places, roles,
        organizations, events, transmission media and phases of events. These
        are called entities. An ISP entity can be unambiguously referenced by
        name in the specifications of tasks and flows, and in the profiles of
        other entities.</p><p>There are actual entities and types of entities. Actual entities
        (&#8220;Jane Smith&#8221;, &#8220;ACME Inc.&#8221;, &#8220;Morristown, Morris County, NJ, USA&#8221; etc.)
        are categorized by types of entities (&#8220;Senior executive&#8221;,
        &#8220;Corporation&#8221;, &#8220;City&#8221; etc.). Entity types can refine other entity
        types (a &#8220;Senior executive&#8221; is an &#8220;Executive&#8221;).</p><p>An <em class="glossterm">agent</em> is either a person or an
        information processing system (system for short). A system is capable
        of sending notifications, answering queries, receiving notifications
        or sending queries. An agent has contact information. An agent's
        clearance is a list of secrecy classifications. A secrecy
        classification has a name (&#8220;NATO&#8221;) and an ordered list of secrecy
        levels (&#8220;Restricted&#8221;, &#8220;Confidential&#8221;, &#8220;Secret&#8221;, &#8220;Focal Top Secret&#8221;,
        &#8220;Cosmic Top Secret&#8221;). An agent type can be thought of as a
        qualification that can be shared by different agents (e.g. "adult" or
        "registered driver"). An agent type is not to be confused with a role.
        An agent can be flagged as a system (non-human). When a group of
        agents are indistinguisable from a planning perspective (for example,
        call center operators), they can be profiled as a single
        <em class="glossterm">archetype</em> agent.</p><p>An <em class="glossterm">organization</em> is a group of agents
        organized to accomplish a mission. An organization assigns roles of
        responsibility to the persons and systems that act on its behalf. An
        organization has contact information and may contain other
        organizations. An organization may have information sharing agreements
        with other organizations to formalize the sharing commitments its
        members have with members of other organizations.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">role</em> is a set of powers and
        responsibilities bestowed by an organization to an agent acting on
        behalf of the organization. A role assignment may be restricted to a
        jurisdiction (a place).</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">place</em> is either a geographical area
        (some city, county, state, country, natural preserve etc.) or a known
        location (some train station, building etc.). A place can be contained
        in another (for example, a building can be in a campus). An event and
        an event type can both be scoped to a place.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">phase</em> names a time period relative to
        an event. A phase of an event is either set to before, during or after
        the event. Typical phases are &#8220;Preparing&#8221;, &#8220;Responding&#8221; and
        &#8220;Recovering&#8221;.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">transmission medium</em> is a means by which
        agents transmit information to one another. A medium is either unicast
        (transmits to a single, known agent), multicast (transmits to
        multiple, known agents) or broadcast (little to no control over who
        receives the transmission). Transmission media may or may not be
        technology-based. &#8220;Telephone&#8221;, &#8220;Email&#8221;, &#8220;Instant Messaging&#8221; are
        examples of unicast communication media, and so is &#8220;Face-to-face&#8221;.
        &#8220;Notification system&#8221; and &#8220;Meeting&#8221; are both multicast media.
        &#8220;Television&#8221;, &#8220;Radio&#8221; and &#8220;PA System&#8221; are examples of broadcast media.
        A transmission medium can delegate transmissions to other media (for
        example, VoIP can interface with Telephones). The security of a medium
        is expressed in terms of secrecy classifications.</p></div><div class="section" title="Issues"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e207"></a>Issues</h3></div></div></div><p>ISP identifies many different kinds of
        <em class="glossterm">issues</em> (70 and counting) about tasks,
        information flows, entities and entire segments and plans. There are
        issues of validity (definition errors), completeness (something
        obvioudly missing from the Plan) and robustness (something that makes
        the Plan failure-prone). An issue has a description, a list of
        suggested remediations, and a severity level (minor, major, severe,
        extreme). The severity is either a constant or it is calculated from
        the potential cascade of task failures attributable to the
        issue.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Benefits and deliverables&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The ISP Method</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
