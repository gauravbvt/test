      Plans for which the user has planning privileges.</p><p>When the Plan Editor opens up on a Plan, Channels pre-selects a
      segment and a task within it. The task with its &#8220;receive&#8221; and &#8220;send&#8221;
      information flows are shown &#8220;collapsed&#8221; and summarized.</p><p>A planner can at any time select to see another version of the
      Plan, if any. A planner can also switch to another assigned Plan. Only
      the development version of a Plan can be modified; retired and
      production versions are &#8220;read-only&#8221; (all form fields are disabled, no
      survey can be launched).</p><p>A planner can at any time select which segment within a Plan to
      view or work on. The tasks and information flows of the selected segment
      are visualized as a flow map (a directed graph). The selected task is
      highlighted (by a gray rectangle) in the flow map.</p><p>The Plan editor window has four principal panels:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The Plan and Segment bar at the top</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The information flow map</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The panels showing the selected task at the bottom</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The collaboration panel to the right</p></li></ul></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1.png"></div></div><div class="section" title="The Plan and Segment Bar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1453"></a>The Plan and Segment Bar</h3></div></div></div><p>The Plan and Segment bar identifies the currently selected
        segment within the currently edited Plan. If applicable, drop down
        menus give the planner access to other versions of the Plan, to other
        Plans, and to others segments within the current Plan.</p><p>A "Show" menu gives access to:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>the collaboration panel, if collapsed</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the Plan panel</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the Segment panel</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>surveys</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>all generated Procedures</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the administration panel (if the use has Administrator
            privileges)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a map of all segments in the Plan</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>and a help window</p></li></ul></div><p>An "Action" menu enables the planner to act on the segment as a
        whole by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>sending a message about the segment</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>adding or pasting a copied task</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>adding an "ad hoc" issue to the segment</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>pasting a copied attachment to the segment</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>moving tasks from this segment to another</p></li></ul></div><p>Other available actions include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Undoing the last action (if possible)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Redoing the last undone action (if possible)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Removing the current segment from the Plan</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Logging out of Channels</p></li></ul></div><p>The Help icon opens a Help window with this content.</p><p>The Left and righ arrow buttons are Channels' "back and forward"
        buttons. They are to be used instead of the browser's back and forward
        button which take users out of Channels.</p><p>Clicking on the name of the segment (upper left corner) opens up
        the "About segment" panel where the name, description and definition
        of the segment can be edited.</p></div><div class="section" title="Information flow map"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1524"></a>Information flow map</h3></div></div></div><p>Tasks are the nodes (icons over text) in the graph and the
        information needs, capabilities and sharing flows are the
        arrows.</p><p>Tasks and flows are drawn in red if they have known issues.
        Green and red traffic lights represent the start and end of the event
        phase covered by the segment. Tasks that are triggered by the start of
        the segment are connected to the green traffic light icon. Tasks that
        terminate the event phase are linked to the red traffic light.</p><p>Information flows (information shared), information needs
        (information needed for carrying out a task) and information
        capabilities (shareable information produced by carrying out a task)
        are shown as arrows. Single-headed arrows represent notifications.
        Double-headed arrows are requests, with the empty arrow head pointing
        to the task that consumes the information request, and with the full
        arrow head pointing to the task that consumes the answer (the
        requested information flows to it).</p><p>Small squares indicate to-be-determined tasks. An arrow from a
        task to a dot represents an information capability of the task
        (information produced by the task that can be shared for use in other
        tasks). An arrow from a small square to a task represents an
        information need of the task (the task needs information possibly
        produced by other tasks).</p><p>When risks and goals are shown in a flow map they appear
        respectively as colored flags and stars connected to tasks and segment
        start and end icons.</p><p>Tasks within a blue rectangle denote tasks from other segments
        that are connected by sharing flows to tasks in the selected
        segment.</p><p>A flow map legend can be shown by clicking on the "help" icon in
        a flow map.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/legend.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Task and flow panels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1548"></a>Task and flow panels</h3></div></div></div><p>The task and flow panels at the bottom of the Plan editor show
        summaries of the selected task (there is always a task selected)
        together with a list of summaries of its "receives"( the task's
        information needs and information flows to it) and a list of its
        "sends" (the task's information capabilities and information flows
        from it). Each summary can be expanded into a form.</p><p>Each of the summaries is prefixed with a colored bullet. The
        color of the bullet indicates how important a task or a flow is. The
        color indicates the calculated impact of the task or the flow failing
        completely. Blue indicates a minor impact, yellow is major, orange is
        severe and red is extreme.</p></div><div class="section" title="Collaboration panel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1555"></a>Collaboration panel</h3></div></div></div><p>The collapsible "collaboration" panel on the right side lets a
        planner see who else is working on the Plan and what they have done
        (their activities). A planner can send messages to a planner or to all
        and can read received messages. The collaboration panel can be
        collapsed if more screen space for the flow map and task/flow forms is
        needed.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1c.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Display controls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1567"></a>Display controls</h3></div></div></div><p>The Plan editor gives the planner some control over the display
        of flow maps, forms used to specify tasks, flows, entities etc., and
        of the collaboration panel.</p><p>Flow maps can be quite large. A flow map can reduced to fit
        within the available space by clicking on the zoom-out icon. Clicking
        on the icon once more brings the flow map back to its normal
        size.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1a.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1b.png"></div></div><p>A flow map can be maximized to use all of the screen space
        allocated to the Plan Editor by clicking on the "maximize" icon. A
        maximized flow map can be reduced to fit. A flow map is un-maximized
        either by clicking once more on the "maximize" icon or by selecting a
        task or a flow within the map.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2a.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2b.png"></div></div><p>A flow map, by defaut, does not display risks and gains (goals)
        and how they relate to tasks or the segment as a whole. To display
        risks and gains, the planner must click on the "goals" icon. Clicking
        again hides the goals.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2c.png"></div></div><p>Clicking on the summary of a task or flow will open its form.
        Channels automatically adapts the width of task and flow forms to ease
        editing. Clicking o the summary closes the form.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2d.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2e.png"></div></div><p>The planner can expand the height of the forms, at the expense
        of the flow map, by pressing the "expand forms" icon.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2f.png"></div></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s02.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Logging in and accessing a Plan and segment&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Editing tasks and flows</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
