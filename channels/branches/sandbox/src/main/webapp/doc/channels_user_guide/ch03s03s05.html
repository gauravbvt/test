        Channels commands. Any change to an IS plan is the result of executing
        a command. Planners execute commands in Channels whenever they create
        and remove segments; when they add, cut, copy and paste tasks, needs,
        capabilities and flows; connect tasks with information flows,
        disconnect them, add an issue, remove a segment, move tasks across
        segments, add an intermediate to a flow, etc.</p><p>Some commands are directly triggered from “actions” menus within
        the context of a plan, segment, task, flow, or entity. Other commands
        are triggered by updating fields in edit forms, or by pressing
        buttons.</p><p>Some commands have simple effects (adding a task, for example)
        but others can be more complex:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>“Disintermediate” removes a task that acts as a middleman in
            a flow</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>“Intermediate” adds a middleman task to a flow</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>“Satisfy all needs” automatically connects information needs
            of a task to matching but untapped information capabilities from
            other tasks</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>"Move tasks" moves one or more tasks from one segment to
            another, possibly also adding goals achieved by the moved tasks to
            the target segment</p></li></ul></div><p>Complex commands are defined in terms of other commands that are
        executed completely or not at all. Most commands are reversible and
        can be undone and redone up and until some planner takes an action
        that would conflict with the undoing or redoing (for example, anyone
        removing a task prevents a planner from undoing a change he/she
        recently did to one of its attributes).</p><p>The execution of each command is journaled for replay should the
        server be interrupted and restarted. It is also recorded and listed in
        the activities tab in the collaboration panel. Channels makes sure
        that only one command is being executed on an IS plan at a time, no
        matter how many planners are working on a plan.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e5849"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.70. Channels commands</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/commands.png" align="middle" alt="Channels commands"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s03s04s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Changing the categorization of an entity </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 4. Appendix</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
