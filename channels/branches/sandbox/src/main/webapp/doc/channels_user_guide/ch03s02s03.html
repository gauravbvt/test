There is really no satisfactory
        answer to this question. Because one could always increase the scope
        of a plan, a more useful question would be: Given its current scope,
        is there something clearly missing from a plan? If the answer is no,
        then the plan can be deemed “complete.”</p><p>Knowing whether the scope of an IS plan is properly set requires
        knowing the domains of human endeavor involved and being able to
        identify the organizations that ought to participate in the plan.
        Absent this knowledge, software can only examine an IS plan to detect
        what is inherently missing from it.</p><p>Nothing is inherently missing from a plan if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Each phase of each event in scope is addressed by at least
              one segment of the plan.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>An event is not self-terminating; each segment addressing
              a co-event phase for that event has at least one task that
              terminates the segment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each segment has at least one defined goal.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each goal listed in a segment is achieved by at least one
              task within that segment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each participating organization and agent within the scope
              of the plan is assigned at least one task.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each task is assigned to at least one agent.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each information sharing flow generates at least one
              information sharing commitment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each task is useful in that it directly achieves a goal,
              or directly or indirectly enables a task that does.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each referenced role in an organization is assigned to at
              least one member agent (if required).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each inter-organizational information sharing commitment
              is covered by a sharing agreement documented by a Memorandum of
              Understanding (if required).</p></li></ul></div><p>The scope of an IS plan can be changed even after it
        is deemed complete. Tasks, flows, and entities that do not contribute
        to completing a plan are considered redundant. Redundant tasks, flows,
        or entities should be removed from a plan. If the scope of a plan is
        reduced, some elements of a plan may become redundant as a
        result.</p><p>The ISP Method proposes three distinct strategies for driving an
        IS plan toward completion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Goal-driven</em></span> strategy - Add
            goal-achieving tasks and work backward to satisfy their
            information needs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Effect-driven</em></span> strategy - Add tasks that
            execute at the onset of event phases and work forward by
            connecting tasks with outgoing flows.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Issue-driven</em></span> strategy - Resolve or
            waive outstanding issues until none remains.</p></li></ul></div><p>Planners usually use of all three strategies opportunistically
        when building an IS plan.</p><div class="section" title="Goal-driven strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d1917e3422"/>Goal-driven strategy</h4></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e3425"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.7. Goal-driven IS plan building</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_driven.png" align="middle" alt="Goal-driven IS plan building"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Planners look at each organizational goal attached to a phase
          of an anticipated event, add tasks that achieve it, and add the
          information needs of each of these tasks. They then add tasks that
          produce the needed information and connect the tasks with
          information flows. This process continues until all goals are
          addressed by tasks, and all task information needs are
          satisfied.</p><p>Step 1 - Select a goal within a segment</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e3435"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.8. A risk mitigation goal in a segment</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_select_goal.png" align="middle" alt="A risk mitigation goal in a segment"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Step 2 - Add a task that achieves the goal</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e3443"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.9. Adding a task that mitigates the risk</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_add_task.png" align="middle" alt="Adding a task that mitigates the risk"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Step 3 - Specify the information needs of the task</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e3451"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.10. Defining the information needs of the risk-mitigating

          tasks and flows, and consequently the IS procedures generated from
          them, are within the scope of the IS plan, because all tasks and
          flows contribute directly or indirectly to addressing identified
          goals. However, this strategy alone does not guarantee that tasks
          triggered by the start of event phases will be included. In other
          words, this "working from the end" strategy does not guarantee that
          it will reach all starting points.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s02s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03s02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s02s03s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Issues </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Effect-driven strategy</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
