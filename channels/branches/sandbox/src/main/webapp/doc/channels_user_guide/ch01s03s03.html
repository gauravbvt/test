        events of significance the plan must address. (A plan's scope is also
        set by the list of organizations that are expected to participate in
        the plan.) An event of significance (or event, for short) is something
        that is true somewhere for some time and that challenges, in and of
        itself, the mission of one or more organizations by introducing risks
        or by creating opportunities for gains. Organizations assign their
        agents to tasks that mitigate these risks or make gains. An event can
        bring different risks or opportunities to different organizations. For
        example, an explosion at a refinery, clearly an event of significance,
        endangers the lives of workers, would likely cause financial losses to
        insurers, and might profit commodity traders.</p><p>The events in an IS plan are not actual events that did or will
        occur at specific times and locations. They are implicitly
        <span class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of events that might happen in some
        indeterminate future in some location that can be identified (e.g., in
        New York City) or specified (e.g., in a large urban area).</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e298"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.13. An event's definition</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/profiling_event.png" align="middle" alt="An event's definition"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Risks and opportunities can exist in the before, during, or
        after <em class="firstterm">phases</em> of an event (<em class="firstterm">event
        phases</em>). Typically the purpose of tasks in a "before"
        phase of an event will be to cause or prevent the event. Tasks in a
        "during" phase of an event will normally be about responding to the
        event as it is unfolding in order to minimize its negative
        consequences or maximize positive outcomes. Tasks in an "after" phase
        will often deal with recovering from the aftermath of an event, or
        reaping its rewards.</p><p>An IS plan will typically focus on at least one, and at most a
        few, events of significance, and cover one or more phases for each of
        these events. Events within the scope of a plan are a combination of
        events that happen outside the control of the participants of the plan
        (so-called <span class="emphasis"><em>incidents</em></span>) and of events caused by
        planned tasks (and are thus under the control of participants).</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e317"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.14. Events in the scope of an IS plan</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/events.png" align="middle" alt="Events in the scope of an IS plan"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>An IS plan should also address only a small, manageable number
        of organizational risks or opportunities stemming from events in
        scope. It is recommended, when starting on a new IS plan, not to
        involve too many organizations having too many goals in too many
        phases of too many events. It is better to start small and focused and
        then grow as needed.</p><p>Information sharing plans typically deal with more than one
        event phase, and they can involve a sizable number of organizations.
        Because plans can become quite large, planners break them into
        smaller, more manageable units of planning called
        <em class="firstterm">segments</em>.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e330"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.15. A segment defined</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/segment_details.png" align="middle" alt="A segment defined"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>An IS plan <em class="glossterm">segment</em> covers only one phase
        of one event, possibly in the context of some other past or currents
        events. For example, a segment might focus on responding to a "stock
        price rally" (event phase focus) during "a volatile market" and after
        a prior "hostile takeover attempt" (context events).</p><p>A segment might address all or only some of the organizational
        goals associated with an event phase. In other words, more than one
        segment may be dedicated to a given event phase, with each segment
        addressing a different list of organizational goals. Two segments
        should not address the same goal for the same event phase.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e343"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.16. Organizational goals addressed in a segment</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/segment_goals.png" align="middle" alt="Organizational goals addressed in a segment"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>A segment lists one or more organization goals (a segment
        without goals is an issue detected by Channels). A
        <span class="emphasis"><em>goal</em></span> is either a risk to an organization (or type
        of organization) to be mitigated, or a gain to be realized by an
        organization (or type of organization). Each risk is categorized from
        a list of types of risks derived from actuarial risk management
        taxonomies. Each gain is also categorized from a list that is the
        "mirror image" of the risk types. Risks are rated as minor, major,
        severe, or extreme. Gains are rated as low, medium, high, or highest.
        Planners can indicate if a risk is implicitly mitigated or a gain
        implicitly realized once the event phase covered by the segment is
        terminated.</p><p>Every task and flow in an IS plan belongs to one and only one
        segment. A segment should contain all the flow-enabled tasks that
        directly achieve the segment's goals, plus flow-enabled tasks on which
        goal-achieving tasks depend to start, terminate, or succeed.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e356"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.17. Goal-achieving tasks and supporting tasks</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/flow_map_goals.png" align="middle" alt="Goal-achieving tasks and supporting tasks"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Segments are normally not disjoint; flows usually connect one or
        more tasks in one segment to tasks in another. Furthermore a task in
        one segment might initiate the event phase addressed by the other
        segment either by causing an event or terminating it. Initiation of an
        event starts the "during" phase of that event and terminates its
        "before" phase. Termination of an event starts the "after" phase of
        that event.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e364"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.18. The inter-connected segments in an IS plan</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/segments.png" align="middle" alt="The inter-connected segments in an IS plan"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">IS plan = IS practices + environment </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Flows and tasks</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
