        when modeling IS practices. For example, IS practices might dictate
        that all employees alert their supervisors if they become aware of
        suspicious activities, whereas managers, who are also employees,
        should not alert their supervisors but rather directly contact the
        head of security.</p><p>Such exceptions in IS practices can be captured by defining
        overriding tasks and by defining prohibited flows from the overriding
        tasks that are otherwise equivalent to flows from the overriden
        tasks.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e691"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.35. Overriding tasks and flows to express exceptions in IS

              segment of task A addresses the same situation as that of task B
              or a more specific version of it);</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>and the assignees to task A are a strict subset of the
              assignees of task B (all agents assignable to task A are also
              assignable to task B but there's fewer of them in task
              A).</p></li></ul></div><p>When task A (for example, "managers detecting threats")
        overrides task B ("employees detecting threats") , agents assigned to
        task A <span class="emphasis"><em>are not assigned</em></span> to the overridden task B.
        Furthermore, if task A is annotated as "prohibited," then no agent is
        assigned to task A and any agent assignable to task B is not assigned
        to task B either. This allows planners to express exceptions such as
        "all employees leave the building except for managers".</p><p>A flow A overrides another flow B if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>they both have the same name (dsicounting case and extra

              the target of flow B</p></li></ul></div><p>If an agent has sharing commitments computed from flow A then
        they replace any and all commitments for this agent computed from the
        overridden flow B. Furthermore, if overriding flow A is prohibited,
        then whoever would have commitments from flow A has commitments from
        neither flow A nor from overriden flow B.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Task assignments and information sharing commitments </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Information sharing agreements</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
