          practices. For example, IS practices might dictate that all employees alert their
          supervisors if they become aware of suspicious activities, whereas managers, who are also
          employees, should not alert their supervisors but rather directly contact the head of
          security.</p><p>Such exceptions in IS practices can be captured by defining overriding tasks and by
          defining prohibited flows from the overriding tasks that are otherwise equivalent to flows
          from the overridden tasks.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e685"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.35. Overriding tasks and flows to express exceptions in IS practices</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/overriding.png" align="middle" alt="Overriding tasks and flows to express exceptions in IS practices"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>A task A overrides a task B if: </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>they both have the same name (discounting uppercase vs lowercase and extraneous

          prohibited, then no agent is assigned to task A and any agent assignable to task B is not
          assigned to task B either. This allows planners to express exceptions such as "all
