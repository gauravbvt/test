        organization commits to share certain information with another
        organization.</p><p>Channels finds the information sharing commitments of agents
        between each pair of organizations and, for each "networking" pair,
        aggregates the commitments into distinct "information sharing
        relationships". Each information sharing relationship is a summary of
        sharing commitments for particular information (the agents in the
        commitments and their roles are abstracted out). For example, an
        information sharing relationship would summarize the fact that members
        of Bank A commit to share fraud information with members of Bank B.
        For each such relationship, planners can indicate whether an
        information sharing commitment has been formalized, and attach or link
        to the document formalizing the agreement.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e735"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.36. The sharing agreements of an organization</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/agreements.png" align="middle" alt="The sharing agreements of an organization"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>An organization may require that its sharing commitments with
        other organizations be covered by sharing agreements. If there is an
        exception to this rule, an issue is raised by Channels. Furthermore,
        if a sharing agreement is confirmed but not documented, an issue is
        also raised. Note that in applying these constraints, Channels does
        not distinguish when both organizations belong to a common parent
        organization and when they do not.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03s09.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03s11.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Expressing exceptions by overriding tasks and flows </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Descriptions, instructions and attachments</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
