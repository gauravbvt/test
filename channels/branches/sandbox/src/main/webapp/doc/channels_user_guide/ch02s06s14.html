        completely at an assigned task or should an agent break a commitment
        to share information. The consequences could be a number of downstream
        tasks failing, leading to gains unachieved or risks
        unmitigated.</p><p>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always
        complete; a failed task does not produce any information that may be
        required by others, and a failed information flow does not transfer
        any information whatsoever.</p><p>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly
        or indirectly depend critically on, or are triggered by, information
        that fails to be produced or to be shared.</p><p>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not
        critical to a task or does not trigger it, then its failure does not
        propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if the target of a flow can get
        the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the failure
        of the flow may not matter. Finally, if information produced by an
        agent is necessarily consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure
        to share is meaningless.</p><p>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful
        tasks. A useful task is one that achieves goals or one that produces
        information that triggers, terminates or is critical to another task that is itself useful. 
        (Useless tasks are flagged as issues.)</p><p>Note that a
        task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end
        and if the risk is said to terminate with the segment.</p><p>A planner does “what-if” failure analysis by selecting a task or
        an information flow (“send” or “receive”) and then looking at the
        consequences should it fail. The planner can take a pessimistic
        outlook and assume that all redundant information flows would also
        fail, no matter what.</p><p>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized
        as a directed graph of information flows, tasks, gains, and risks.
        Risks that would otherwise be mitigated or terminated by failed tasks
        are shown as color-coded flags. Red is for extreme risks, orange is
        for severe risks, yellow for major risks, and blue for minor risks.
        Risks that would normally be mitigated by successful tasks are shown
        connected to these tasks. Risks that would be terminated, should a
        segment end, are shown connected to red stop lights. Each stop light
        is itself connected to a failed task that would normally end the
        segment.</p><p>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by
        importance, with red for very high, orange for high, yellow for
        medium, and blue for low.</p><p>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed,
        goal-achieving tasks (the failures that matter) is compiled and
        presented. The table is paginated and the columns (failing task,
        segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization
        impacted) can be sorted.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e2936"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.128. Accessing the failure impact analysis on a task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/failure_impact_access_task.png" align="middle" alt="Accessing the failure impact analysis on a task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e2942"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.129. Failure impacts of a failed task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/failure_impact_task.png" align="middle" alt="Failure impacts of a failed task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Failure analysis crosses segment boundaries.
