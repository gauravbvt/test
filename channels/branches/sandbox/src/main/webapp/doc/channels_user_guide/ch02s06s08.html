        editor show summaries of the selected task (there is always a task
        that is selected) together with a list of summaries of its "receives"
        (the task's information needs and the information flows to it) and a
        list of its "sends" (the task's information capabilities and the
        information flows from it). Each summary can be expanded into a form
        for editing (if the development version of the plan was the one
        selected on the Home page).</p><p>Each of the summaries is prefixed with a colored bullet. The
        color of the bullet indicates how important a task or a flow is. The
        color indicates the calculated impact of the task or the flow failing
        completely. Blue indicates a minor impact, yellow is major, orange is
        severe, and red is extreme. Gray bullets are used when failure impact
        does not apply (information needs and capabilities).</p><p>Clicking on the summary of a task or flow expands it by opening
        its edit form. Channels automatically adapts the width of task and
        flow forms to provide ease of editing. Clicking on the summary closes
        the form.</p><p>Note that, with very few exceptions, any and all fields in any
        form in Channels can be left blank. Of course, leaving <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> fields in a form blank is of little value.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e1786"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.51. Task, send and receive panels can be expanded</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/task_flow_panels.png" align="middle" alt="Task, send and receive panels can be expanded"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="section" title="Editing a task"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d1917e1792"/>Editing a task</h4></div></div></div><p>A task is defined by naming it, categorizing it, tagging it,
          and flagging it, or not, as operational and/or prohibited.
          (Remember, everything is optional.) It is further defined by stating
          where it is to be executed, by whom, in what role within what
          jurisdiction, and on behalf of what organization. Any of the
          location, agent, jurisdiction, role, and organization entities that
          specify a task can be left unnamed so as to imply that more than one
          agent can be assigned to the task. The names of entities can be
          indicated to refer to actual entities (Morristown, NJ, John Doe,
          ACME, etc.) or to types of entities (a city, a certified technician,
          a corporation, etc.).</p><p>The execution of a task can be set to be “as a team” to
          indicate that all assigned agents are to work together when carrying
          out the task. By default, assignees are each to execute the task
          independently.</p><p>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to
          complete, whether it repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts
          automatically with the segment (implying that the assigned agents
          would become aware on their own of the onset of the segment's event
          phase).</p><p>The purpose of a task can be stated as causing an event,
          terminating the event phase addressed by the segment, mitigating one
          or more risks, or achieving gains within the segment's scope.</p><p>Reference and policy documents can be attached to the task
          either by URL or by uploading them. Finally, the task can be given a
          brief, informal set of instructions.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e1805"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.52. Edit form for a task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/task_form.png" align="middle" alt="Edit form for a task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>As for any plan element, a planner can add issues to those
          automatically detected about the task. Issues added by a planner can
          later be removed by any other planner. Issues detected by Channels
          cannot be removed, but can be waived.</p><p>The task's "Show" menu opens various views on the task,
