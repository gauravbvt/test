      transmission medium) is automatically created when it is first
      referenced by name. Channels requires that all entities of a given kind
      be assigned unique names (John Smith, John Smith (1), John Smith (2)
      etc.).</p><p>Recall that the definitions of Plan elements can reference both
      actual entities (ACME Corporation, Peter Sanchez, Morristown NJ) and
      types of entities (a corporation, a certified emergency technician, a
      city). An entity is classified by tagging it with the names of entity
      types. An entity can only be tagged with entity types of its own kind
      (Warehouse A can be tagged as a building but not as a senior executive).
      Both actual entities and entity types can be edited.</p><p>An editable profile of an entity , actual or type, can be opened
      from wherever the entity is referenced by name, be it in the
      specification of a task, the definition of a segment, or in an aggregate
      or analytical view.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_8.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_8a.png"></div></div><p>Keep in mind that events, roles and transmission media in a Plan
      are always types. There is no actual event in a Plan because events are
      always anticipated. There is no such thing as an &#8220;actual role&#8221; because
      roles are always concepts. Transmission media are also always types
      because a Plan only cares about the class of a transmission
      medium.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Details view</em></span> shows the profile of an
      entity. All entity profiles, whether they are actual or types are
      composed of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>a unique name</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a description (free text)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>a classification (a list of entity types of the same
          kind)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>document attachments</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition, an entity profile always includes an index of all
      references to the entity (and matches, if the entity is a type), a list
      of all issues about the entity proper, and a filterable collection of
      all entities that releate to the entity.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_9a.png"></div></div><p>Each kind of entity has additional, specific attributes that can
      also be set.</p><div class="section" title="Profiling an organization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1764"></a>Profiling an organization</h3></div></div></div><p>A planner profiling an actual organization can define its
        mission and set its location, contact information, and parent
        organization.</p><p>A planner can declare that it si an issue if a sharing
        commitment by the organization with another is not covered by an
        agreement, and that it is also an issue if there is a role assigned by
        the organization in the Plan for which no agent is known.</p><p>A planner can add entries to an organization's
        membership/employment roster, by naming for each entry an agent, a
        role, a jurisdiction (optional), a title and a supervisor agent
        (optional). Alternately, the planner can confirm memberships that are
        already implied by task specifications (a task specification can
        identify an agent in a role within a jurisdiction for an
        organization).</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_9.png"></div></div><p>Inter-organizational sharing commitments are inferred from
        information flows that are sourced from tasks assignable to members of
        the organization. A sharing agreement may or may not exist for a
        sharing commitment that crosses organizational boundaries. It is an
        issue if an inter-organizational sharing commitment is unconfirmed as
        required by the organization. When viewing an organization, a planner
        can see the sharing commitments the organization makes with other
        organizations and confirm whether each commitment is covered or not by
        an agreement.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_10a.png"></div></div><p>In the Details view of any kind of entity, references to the
        entity are listed in a filterable and paged index. Task assignments
        and sharing commitments for the organization, as well as issues about
        the organization, if any, are shown at the bottom of the view.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_10.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Profiling an agent"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1798"></a>Profiling an agent</h3></div></div></div><p>The profile attributes specific to an actual agent are: whether
        or not the agent is an archetype, whether it is a system or a person,
        its contact information (transmission media with endpoints where
        applicable), and its security clearances (secrecy
        classifications).</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>whether or not the agent is an archetype,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>whether it is a system or a person,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>its contact information (transmission media with endpoints
            where applicable),</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>and its security clearances (secrecy classifications)</p></li></ul></div><p>In addition to profile attributes, the Details view of an agent
        lists the roles played by the agent, the agent's task assignments and
        sharing commitments, all references to the agent (indexed) and all
        issues detected or reported specifically about the agent.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_68.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Profiling a place"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1825"></a>Profiling a place</h3></div></div></div><p>When profiling an actual place, a planner can identify what
        other place, if any, contains it. A planner can also give the place a
        street address, postal code and a geoname. If the geoname is
        ambiguous, more specific geonames are offered for selection.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_55.png"></div></div><p>When profiling a type of place, a planner can specify that for
        actual places to be of this type they must:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>must be inside</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem"><p>the plan's locale or</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the location of a planned event or</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>another actual or type of place</p></li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem"><p>must contain</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem"><p>the plan's locale or</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the location of a planned event or</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>another actual or type of place</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_55a.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Profiling a transmission medium"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1873"></a>Profiling a transmission medium</h3></div></div></div><p>When editing a transmission medium, a planner can set the
        transmission mode to either unicast (one -to-one), multicast
        (one-to-many) or broadcast (one-to-any), unless the mode is already
        implied by another medium this one is tagged with (to make it a
        special case of it).</p><p>The address pattern is a &#8220;regular expression&#8221; that constrains
        the form an &#8220;address&#8221; can take for this medium. An empty pattern
        imposes no constraint.</p><p>A planner can identify the media, if any, this one can interface
        with as it carries out transmissions from sender to receiver.</p><p>Finally, a planner can describe the security of the transmission
        medium in terms of security classifications. Qualifying a medium as
        &#8220;US Gov/Top Secret&#8221; means that Top Secret information can be
        transmitted securely over this medium.</p><p>Keep in mind that all transmission media are types; there is no
        such thing in ISP as an actual transmission medium.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_67.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Defining an event"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1893"></a>Defining an event</h3></div></div></div><p>An event in ISP is always an entity type (all events in ISP are
        anticipated). A planner can set the location (actual or type) where
        the event would occur. A planner can also indicate whether or not this
        type event can terminate on its own, without the intervention of any
        agent.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_79.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Defining a phase"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1905"></a>Defining a phase</h3></div></div></div><p>Planners can introduce any number of phases within the scope of
        a Plan. In addition to setting generic entity attributes (name,
        description, classification), a planner indicates whether a phase is
        before an event (pre-event), during an event (co-event) or after an
        event (post-event).</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_80.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Entity network views"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1917"></a>Entity network views</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Network view</em></span> is available on agents,
        roles, and organizations. It displays a network graph depicting how
        the entity is connected by information flows to other entities of the
        same kind via sharing commitments. This analytical view allows a
        planner to filter commitment-generating information flows to, say,
        show only the ones from tasks executed by a specific role. The network
        graph is navigable. The list of flows can be further filtered, sorted
        and paged. Listed flows can also be navigated to.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_11.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_11a.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_11b.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Entity issues view"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1946"></a>Entity issues view</h3></div></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Issues view</em></span> collects and filters issues
        that are about an entity or that are related to it.</p><p>Waived issues can be included in or excluded from the sortable,
        page-able list of issues.</p><p>Surveys, whether ongoing, closed, or to-be-created, are
        accessible from each listed issue. Only planners can launch or close
        surveys. A survey gathers the opinions of planners and non-planners
        alike on how a particular issue should be remediated.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_12.png"></div></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s05.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch03s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Segment scoping&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Acquiring and releasing edit locks</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
