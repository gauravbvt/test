                A segment's edit form is accessed by selecting &#8220;About segment&#8221; from
                the top-most &#8220;Show&#8221; menu.

                be renamed and where the phase and event it references can be changed.
                As with any other kind of Plan element, reference and policy documents
                can be attached to a segment.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_5.png"></div></div><p>The scope of a segment is further defined by identifying and
                describing a set of goals of organizations that relate to the
                segment's event phase. Goals can be risks to be mitigated or gains to
                be achieved. These goals are expected to be realized by tasks in the
                segment. Risks can also be curtailed by tasks that terminate the event
                phase. To be considered useful, tasks that do not curtail nor mitigate
                a risk or do not make gains are expected to at least provide
                information that is directly or indirectly needed by tasks that
                do.

                <span class="emphasis"><em>Goals view</em></span>
                of a segment lets planners
                define the goals of organizations that are in scope. Goals can be
                added and removed. A goal is for an organization either to mitigate a
                risk or to make a gain. A goal is given a type (picked from a taxonomy
                of risks or gains), an importance (minor, major, severe for risks,
                low, medium or high for gains), the identity of the organization
                (either an actual organization or a type of organization), and whether
                the goal goes away when the event phase covered by the segment
                terminates.
            </p><p>The tasks that mitigate a given risk or achieve a goal in scope
                can be listed, sorted and navigated to.
