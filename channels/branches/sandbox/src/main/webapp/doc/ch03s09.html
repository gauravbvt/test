      completely at an assigned task or should a commitment to share
      information be broken. The consequences could be a number of
      “downstream” tasks failing leading to gains unachieved or risks
      unmitigated.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_60.png"/></div></div><p>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always
      complete; a failed task does not produce any information that may be
      required by others, and a failed information flow does not transfer any
      information whatsoever.</p><p>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly
      or indirectly depend critically on or are triggered by information that
      fails to be produced or to be shared.</p><p>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not
      critical to a task or does not trigger it, then its failure does not
      propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if the target of a flow can get
      the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the flow's
      failure does not matter. Finally, if information produced by an agent is
      necessarily consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure to share
      is meaningless.</p><p>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful
      tasks, that is, tasks that either achieve stated goals or produce
      information that triggers or is critical to other tasks that are
      themselves useful. (Useless tasks are flagged as issues.) Note that a
      task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end (or, more to
      the point, if it causes the event phase the segment is about to end) and
      if the risk is said to terminate with the segment.</p><p>A planner does “what-if”, failure analysis by selecting a task or
      by selecting an information flow (“send” or “receive”) and then looking
      at the consequences should it fail. The planner can take a pessimistic
      outlook and assume that all redundant information flows would also fail,
      no matter what.</p><p>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized as
      a directed graph of information flows, tasks, gains and risks. Risks
      that would otherwise be mitigated or terminated by failed tasks are
      shown as color-coded flags. Orange is for severe risks, yellow for major
      risks and blue for minor risks. Risks that would normally be mitigated
      by successful tasks are shown connected to these tasks. Risks that would
      be terminated, should a segment end, are shown connected to red stop
      lights. Each stop light is itself connected to a failed task that would
      normally end the segment.</p><p>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by
      importance, with orange for high, yellow for medium and blue for
      low.</p><p>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed,
      goal-oriented tasks (the failures that matter) is compiled and
      presented. The table is paginated and the columns (failing task,
      segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization impacted)
      can be sorted.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_58.png"/></div></div><p>Failure analysis crosses segment boundaries. A failed task in one
      segment can cause tasks to fail in other segments. Tasks, flows and
      goals in segments other than the selected segment are put in blue boxes
      representing the other segments.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_59.png"/></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s08.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s10.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Viewing task assignments and sharing commitments </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Actions</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
