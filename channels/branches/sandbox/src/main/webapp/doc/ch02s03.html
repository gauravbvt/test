                fields for the editable attributes of the task. The &#8220;sends&#8221; of the
                task (information shared by the task plus its information
                capabilities) and the &#8220;receives&#8221; of the task (information shared with
                the task plus its information needs) can also each be expanded into
                their edit forms.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_3.png"></div></div><p>A task is defined by first naming it. It is further defined by
                stating where it is to be executed, by whom, in what role, for what
                jurisdiction, and on behalf of what organization. Any of the location,
                agent, jurisdiction, role, and organization (entities) that specify a
                task can be left unnamed so as to imply that more than one agent can
                be assigned to the task. When the entities are named, the names can
                identify actual entities (Morritown, NJ, John Doe, ACME etc.) or types
                of entities (a city, a certified technician, a corporation
                etc.).
            </p><p>The execution of a task can be set to be &#8220;as a team&#8221; to indicate
                that all assignees are to work together when carrying out the task. By
                default, assignees are each to execute the task independently.
            </p><p>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to
                complete, whether it repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts
                automatically with the segment (implying that the assigned agents
                would become aware of the onset of the event phase on their
                own).
            </p><p>The purpose of a task can be stated as terminating the event
                phase of the segment, mitigating one or more risks or achieve gains
                within the segment's scope.
            </p><p>Related reference and policy documents can be attached to the
                task either by URL or by uploading them. Finally, the task can be
                given a brief, informal description.
            </p><p>When editing a &#8220;receive&#8221; or a &#8220;send&#8221;, the information needed,
                produced or to be shared is named and its elements are enumerated, and
                each assigned individual secrecy classifications and optional sourcing
                and handling instructions.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_57.png"></div></div><p>The mode of communication is given as either notification or
                by-request (push or pull).
            </p><p>If an information flow (information that's shared) is a
                notification, then it can be made a broadcast (information will be
                shared with all agents assigned to the target task) or a unicast
                (information will be shared with at least one agent assigned to the
                target task).
            </p><p>Keep in mind that an information flow that is a &#8220;send&#8221; to a task
                producing shared information is the same information flow that is a
                &#8221;receive&#8221; to the task consuming the shared information. One is looking
                at one flow from its two ends.
            </p><p>An information flow is created by first adding an information
                need to a task (if necessary), then adding an information capability
                of the same name in another (also if necessary), and then connecting
                the need to the capability or vice-versa by setting the &#8220;from&#8221; or &#8220;to&#8221;
                field to the other task.
            </p><p>A communication delay is set either to zero (communication is to
                happen without delay) or to some finite time interval. For an
                information need, the delay represents the timeliness requirement for
                being notified or for getting a response to a request. For an
                information capability, the delay represents how quickly the
                information could be produced and communicated. For a sharing flow,
                the delay represents a &#8220;quality of service&#8221; commitment.
            </p><p>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
                can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
                information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
                is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
                that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
                listed in order of preference.
            </p><p>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
                can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
                information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
                is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
                that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
                listed in order of preference.
            </p><p>When editing a &#8220;send&#8221; or &#8220;receive&#8221;, a planner can set whether
                sharing would normally trigger or terminate a task. A notification
                could trigger or terminate the receiving task. It could also terminate
                the sending task, if sending the notification concludes the task that
                produced the information. A request could trigger the task that
                produces the requested response.
            </p><p>Planners can attach documents to a &#8220;send&#8221; or &#8220;receive&#8221;. A
                document can be a reference (it documents), a mandating policy (it
                obligates sharing), a prohibiting policy (it prohibits sharing), a
                multiple policy (contains language that imposes obligations and
                restrictions) or it can be an image provided as an illustration (for
                example, a screenshot). If an information flow has a prohibiting
                policy attached to it then there can not be any implied sharing
                commitment.
            </p><p>As with any Plan elements, a planner can add issues to those
                detected about tasks or its &#8220;sends&#8221; or &#8220;receives&#8221;. Manually added
                issues can be removed.
