      <title>Why plan information sharing</title>

      <para>Organizations operate in an increasingly inter-connected and
      inter-dependent world. Systemic risks are growing. Organizations must
      network to compete in a global marketplace. They can no longer respond
      to major crisis nor can they seize global business opportunities on
      their own.</para>

      <para>Success now largely depends on the timely and targeted sharing of
      information within and between organizations. During a crisis,
      information will not spontaneously flow as needed. Maintaining contact
      lists is not enough; organizations must plan ahead and create actionable
      information sharing procedures.</para>

      <para>Information Sharing Planning provides a framework and method for
      designing and improving the information sharing procedures required to
      successfully manage systemic risks and seize opportunities.</para>

      <title>Benefits and deliverables</title>

      <para><emphasis>Information Sharing Planning captures, analyzes and
      deploys knowledge of how organizations need to share information to
      mitigate systemic risks and seize opportunities from anticipated events.
      </emphasis></para>

      <para>Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces information sharing
      procedures for event preparedness, response and recovery. Information
      Sharing Plans capture commitments to share the information required for
      organizations to fulfill their missions.</para>

      <para>ISP uncovers:</para>

          points of failure.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It is important understand that an Information Sharing Plan is
      <emphasis>not</emphasis> an action plan; it's objective is not to
      dictate a sequence of actions nor is it to optimize processes.<footnote>
          <para>However, task sequencing is not entirely absent from ISP. The
          execution of a task may require information produced by the prior
          execution of another task. These sequencing constraints do not
          typically apply to all tasks and they certainly do not dictate a
          unique ordering for all tasks. The fact that an IS Plan does not
          dictate a strict sequence of tasks is a good thing. Attempting to
          define an action plan for organizations that don't have a central
          authority can be an exercise in futility. What really matters here
          is capturing what needs to be done and then how information must
          flow to make it possible.</para>
        </footnote>Information sharing planning concerns itself exclusively
      with capturing the information sharing requirements of tasks that must
      be executed to manage disruptive events.</para>

      <section>
        <title>In a nutshell</title>

        <para>An <firstterm linkend="information_sharing_plan">Information
        Sharing Plan</firstterm> captures the <firstterm
        linkend="information_sharing_procedure">information sharing
        procedures</firstterm> (<firstterm linkend="task">tasks</firstterm>
        and information sharing) that people and systems (<firstterm
        linkend="agent">agents</firstterm>) in <firstterm
        linkend="role">roles</firstterm> of responsibility are expected to
        apply, within their <firstterm
        linkend="jurisdiction">jurisdictions</firstterm>, in order to fulfill
        the missions of their <firstterm
        linkend="organization">organizations</firstterm> before, during and/or
        after <firstterm linkend="event">events</firstterm> of
        significance.</para>

        <para>Tasks manage <firstterm linkend="risk">risks</firstterm>,
        achieve <firstterm linkend="gain">gains</firstterm> and/or produce
        information needed by other tasks. <firstterm
        linkend="information_sharing_flow">Information sharing
        flows</firstterm> connect tasks that produce information with tasks
        that consume it. Shared information is communicated over <firstterm
        linkend="transmission_medium">transmission media</firstterm> or face
        to face. Sharing can be subject to <firstterm
        linkend="policy">policies</firstterm>.</para>

        <para>A task specifies, in more or less generic terms, which agents
        should be assigned to it, individually or as teams. Information
        sharing procedures are generated by matching agents within the scope
        of the Plan to the tasks. Agents are bound by <firstterm
        linkend="information_sharing_commitment">information sharing
        commitments</firstterm> whenever they are assigned to tasks that are
        connected by flows to other tasks. These agents commit to share the
        <firstterm linkend="information">information</firstterm> they produce
        with all agents who execute the connected-to tasks that consume it. An
        implied but important constraint is that information can only be used
        to execute tasks for which it is explicitly shared.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Plan segments</title>

        <para>Information sharing plans typically deal with more than one
        phase of more that one anticipated event, and they can involve a large
        number of organizations. Because plans can become quite large,
        planners break them into smaller, more manageable units of planning
        called segments.</para>

        <para>An information sharing <glossterm>segment</glossterm> covers
        only one phase of one event and addresses some of the related
        organizational goals. A segment will typically focus on just a few
        goals. Segments usually depend on other segments. Two segments are
        co-dependent when information produced by a task in one segment is
        consumed by a task in the other, or when a task in one segment
        initiates the event phase covered by the other segment.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Tasks and flows</title>

        <para>A task describes an action carried out at some location and for
        some purpose by one or more agents. Agents act to fulfill the
        responsibilities of roles bestowed on them by organizations. The
        agents expected to carry out a task can be identified by any
        combination of name, role, jurisdiction and organization. The executor
        of a task may be identified only partially (for example, by role and
        organization only) so that more than one person or system will match
        the profile and get assigned to the task. According to a tasks'
        definition, those assigned to the task are expected to carry it out
        either as a team or on their own.</para>

        <para>Tasks are considered useful if they:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>directly achieve risk mitigation or gains,</para>

        <para><glossterm>Information flows</glossterm> link tasks that produce
        information to tasks that consume it. A flow is characterized
        by:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the information communicated (down to its elements, each
            with optional secrecy classifications and optional sourcing and

      <section>
        <title>Entities</title>

        <para>Plans, segments, tasks, information needs, capabilities and
        sharing flows are defined in terms of agents, places, roles,
        organizations, events, transmission media and phases of events. These
        are called entities. An ISP entity can be unambiguously referenced by
        name in the specifications of tasks and flows, and in the profiles of
        other entities. An entity in ISP is anything that can be named while
        not something an agent does.</para>

        <para>There are actual entities and types of entities. Actual entities
        (“Jane Smith”, “ACME Inc.”, “Morristown, Morris County, NJ, USA” etc.)
        are categorized by types of entities (“Senior executive”,
        “Corporation”, “City” etc.). Entity types can refine other entity
        types (a “Senior executive” is an “Executive”).</para>

        <para>An <glossterm>agent</glossterm> is either a person or an
        information system (system for short). A system is capable of sending
        notifications, answering queries, receiving notifications or sending
        queries. An agent has contact information and availability (24/7 by
        default). An agent's clearance is a list of secrecy classifications. A
        secrecy classification has a name (“NATO”) and an ordered list of
        secrecy levels (“Restricted”, “Confidential”, “Secret”, “Focal Top
        Secret”, “Cosmic Top Secret”). An agent type can be thought of as a
        qualification that can be shared by different agents (e.g. "adult" or
        "registered driver"). An agent type is not to be confused with a role.
        A role implies responsibilities whereas an agent type denotes
        qualifications or status. An agent can be flagged as a system
        (non-human). When a group of agents are indistinguisable from a
        planning perspective (for example, call center operators), they can be
        profiled as a single <glossterm>archetype</glossterm> agent (for
        example, "a call center operator").</para>

        <para>An <glossterm>organization</glossterm> is a group of agents
        organized to accomplish a mission. An organization assigns roles of
        responsibility to the persons and systems that act on its behalf. An
        organization has contact information and may contain other
        organizations. An organization may have information sharing agreements
        with other organizations to formalize the sharing commitments its
        members have with members of other organizations.</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>role</glossterm> is a set of powers and
        responsibilities bestowed by an organization to an agent acting on
        behalf of the organization. A role assignment may be restricted to a
        jurisdiction (a place).</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>place</glossterm> is either a geographical area
        (some city, county, state, country, natural preserve etc.) or a known
        location (some train station, building etc.). A place can be contained
        in another (for example, a building can be in a campus). An event and
        an event type can both be scoped to a place.</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>phase</glossterm> names a time period relative to
        an event. A phase of an event is either set to before, during or after
        the event. Typical phases are “Preparing”, “Responding” and
        “Recovering”.</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>transmission medium</glossterm> is a means by which
        agents transmit information to one another. A medium is either unicast
        (transmits to a single, known agent), multicast (transmits to
        multiple, known agents) or broadcast (little to no control over who
        receives the transmission). Transmission media may or may not be
        technology-based. “Telephone”, “Email”, “Instant Messaging” are
        examples of unicast communication media, and so is “Face-to-face”.
        “Notification system” and “Meeting” are both multicast media.
        “Television”, “Radio” and “PA System” are examples of broadcast media.
        A transmission medium can delegate transmissions to other media (for
        example, VoIP can interface with Telephones). The security of a medium
        is expressed in terms of secrecy classifications.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Issues</title>

        <para>ISP identifies many different kinds of
        <glossterm>issues</glossterm> (80 and counting) about tasks,
        information flows, entities and entire segments and plans. There are
        issues of validity (definition errors), completeness (something
        obvioudly missing from the Plan) and robustness (something that makes
        the Plan failure-prone). An issue has a description, a list of
        suggested remediations, and a severity level (minor, major, severe,
        extreme). The severity is either a constant or it is calculated from
        the potential cascade of task failures attributable to the
        issue.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>The meaning of information in ISP</title>

        <para>Tasks and flows are defined in terms of information needed,
        uncovered and shared. The information is named and is broken into
        atomic elements. Each element of information is named, can be given
        security classifications and can be annotated with a description,
        handling instructions and with transformative relationships to other
        elements of information.</para>

        <para>An element of information is considered atomic for the purposes
        of a plan; it is the indivisible unit of transmission and
        transformation.</para>

        <para>The notion of the plurality of an element is left undefined. For
        example, if "suspicious activity report" information contains the
        element "suspect profile" then it is possible that there will be more
        than one suspect profiles in a report.</para>

        <para>When analyzing flows, Channels is not concerned with what the
        information actually means. Rather it cares about whether or not two
        flows share the same information, and whether an element of
        information is the same as, or is the transformation of, another
        element of information.</para>

        <para>If the information in two flows share the same name, does it
        mean that they represent, conceptually, the same information? Not
        necessarily. Two tasks performed respectively by a EOC commander and a
        corporate CEO and both needing a "situation assessment" would likely
        not need that same elements of information (even if the elements
        themselves have identical names).</para>

        <para>In Channels, identically named flows, needs and capabilities
        (ignoring uppercase vs lowercase and extra spaces) are meant to
        represent the same kind of information (they are synonymous)
        <emphasis>only if</emphasis> they connect to the same task
        specification. Similarly, identically named elements of information
        represent the same atom of information <emphasis>only if</emphasis>
        they compose synonymous information.</para>

        <para>Agents executing a task receive and send information. The
        information they receive and send may have different names an yet have
        common elements of information. For example, the "suspect profile"
        element of a sent "suspicious activity report" information may be the
        same as the "suspect description" element of a received "security
        tip", and it may be the same as the "suspect profile" of received
        "BOLO" information.</para>

        <para>Alternately, an element sent may aggregate elements received.
        Aggregation combines many elements into a single element, with loss of
        data. For example, a "suspects count" element aggregates "suspect
        profile" elements into a single number, losing the details of the
        individual profiles. Counting is only one of many kinds of possible
        aggregations. A "threat level", for example, might aggregate a great
        deal of different elements into a rating.</para>

        <para>In order to track the dissemination of information, it necessary
        to indicate when sent elements are renamed or are aggregated. Channels
        need only differentiate between two kinds of element transformation,
        renaming and aggregation, in order to track the dissemination of
        information. The description field of an element of information can be
        used to provide more details about the specific nature of an
        aggregation.</para>

        <para>Issue detection takes element renaming and aggregation into
        account. For example, while it may be acceptable to declassify
        aggregated elements, it is not acceptable to declassify a renamed,
        classified element.</para>

    <title>The ISP Method</title>

    <para>Information sharing planners (Planners) apply the ISP Method to
    build information sharing plans (Plans) from which robust information
    sharing procedures (Procedures) can be generated. These Procedures enable

      <para>ISP Method activities (Activities) should not be confused with
      Best Practices. For example, a Best Practice might help planners decide
      what the scope a Plan should be, whereas an Activity would prescribe how
      to capture the scope of a Plan (once decided upon) and indicate which
      Activities are triggered by changes to the scope.</para>

      <title>From Plans to Procedures</title>

      <para>A Plan consists of tasks that achieve organizational goals during
      various phases of anticipated events. These tasks consume information
      that may be produced by other tasks and then shared by the agents who
      execute them.</para>

      <para>Known agents from participating organizations are assigned (or
      not) to tasks based on whether the profile of each agent matches the
      specifications of who is meant to execute a given task. The profile of
      an agent is defined in terms of the agent’s qualifications, the roles
      the agent plays in organizations, and the agent’s jurisdictions.</para>

      <para>When a flow connects an information-producing task (source task)
      with an information-consuming task (target task), then all agents
      assigned to the source task, possibly subject to restrictions, commit to
      sharing information with the agents assigned to the target task. The
      information is strictly to be used for the execution of the target
      task.</para>

      <title>Building a Plan</title>

      <para>A Plan is built by information sharing planners (Planners) who
      carry out Activities defined in the ISP Method in order to move the Plan
      toward completion.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Activities</title>

        <para>Activities either alter the scope of a Plan, bring the Plan
        closer to completion, or improve the quality and value of the
        Procedures generated from it.</para>

        <para>Activities are organized into these four groups:<itemizedlist>

        <para>There is no fixed, prescribed order to the execution of
        Activities. Scope can be modified at any time while a Plan is being
        built. Tasks and information flows can also be specified at any time.
        Entities (events, roles, organizations, agents, phases, places,
        transmission media etc.) can be profiled as soon they are mentioned by
        name in the specifications of tasks and information flows, the
        profiles of other entities, or in the definition of the Plan’s scope.
        A Plan should be improved early and often in order to keep it as
        manageable and as valuable as possible.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Issues</title>

        <para>The ISP Method defines a relatively large number of issues that
        relate to a Plan’s</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>validity</emphasis> (something is incorrectly
            specified or defined),</para>

            missing), or</para>

          <listitem>

            failure-prone).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>An issue can be about the Plan as a whole or about an element of
        the Plan (a task specification, role profile, segment definition
        etc.).</para>

        <para>An issue has a severity of low, medium, high, very high or
        extreme. The severity of an issue is either constant or computed by
        determining the severity of a potential cascade of failures caused by
        the issue.</para>

        <para>An issue comes with one or more alternate options for
        remediation. Some issues are “best guesses” and can be waived by
        Planners.</para>

        <para>All defined issues can be automatically detected by software.
        Planners can report other, ad hoc issues; these will typically be
        domain-specific issues.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Moving to completion</title>

        <para>When is a plan complete? Because one could always increase the
        scope of a Plan, a more useful question would be: Given its current
        scope, is there something clearly missing from a Plan? If the answer
        is no, then the Plan can be considered “complete”.</para>

        <para>Nothing is clearly missing from a Plan if:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Each phase of each event in scope is addressed by at least
              one segment of the Plan (see definition of segment).</para>

            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>The scope of a plan can be changed even after it is
        deemed complete. Plan tasks, flows and entities that do not contribute
        to completing a Plan are considered redundant. Redundant tasks, flows
        or entities should be removed from a Plan. If the scope of a Plan is
        reduced, some elements of a plan may become redundant.</para>

        <para>There are three distinct strategies for driving a Plan to
        completion:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>goals-driven</emphasis>,</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>effect-driven</emphasis> and</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>issue-driven</emphasis>.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Planners will usually use of all three strategies at
        once.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Goal-driven strategy</title>

          <para>Planners look at each organizational goal attached to a phase
          of an anticipated event, specify tasks that achieve it, and the
          information needs of each of these tasks. They then specify tasks
          that produce the needed information and connect the tasks with
          sharing flows. This process continues until all goals are addressed
          by tasks and all task information needs are satisfied.</para>

          <para>Tasks and flows thus specified and, consequently, the
          Procedures generated from them are necessarily within the scope of
          the Plan, since they all contribute directly or indirectly to
          addressing identified goals.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Effect-driven strategy</title>

          <para>Planners start with the onset of an event phase, specify tasks
          that are directly triggered by it. They then specify the information
          produced by the tasks. and then the tasks that would be triggered or
          terminated by sharing this information. Planners connect the tasks
          with sharing flows as appropriate. This process continues until no
          task gets triggered or terminated by information produced by
          specified tasks.</para>

          <para>Some tasks and flows specified using this strategy (and thus
          Procedures generated from them) might not all belong within the
          scope of the Plan since they do not necessarily contribute directly
          or indirectly to addressing identified goals.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Issue-driven strategy</title>

          <para>Planners scan the list of detected issues. Issues can be about
          validity (incorrectly defined plan elements), completeness (plan
          elements obviously missing) and robustness (Procedures are resilient
          to failures). They then select an issue to be addressed and 1- waive
          the issue (if applicable and if the issue is a false negative), or
          2- decide on applying a remediation Activity (possibly chosen from
          recommendations provided with the issue). The process is repeated
          until all outstanding issues are waived.</para>

          <para>A Plan with no outstanding, “unwaived” issues could be
          considered valid, complete and robust, assuming that all possible
          material issues were indeed detected (an assumption that is
          impossible to verify).</para>
        </section>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Activities</title>

      <para>An ISP Method Activity is carried out by a Planner to achieve an
      outcome that (ideally) brings a plan closer to completion. An Activity
      is composed of a number of steps, many or all optional, often carried
      out in no specific order. Most Activities can be undone (for example, a
      specified task can be later removed). When they exist, the prerequisites
      for an Activity are usually few and commonsensical; for example, a task
      in a segment can not be specified unless the segment is already
      defined.</para>

      <para>The outcomes of an Activity can be completely or partially undone
      at any time. This is accomplished by removing a task specification,
      deleting a Plan segment, removing a member from an organization,
      reverting to a prior specification or definition etc.). Such “reverse
      Activities” are not listed but are usually implied.</para>

      <para>Prior to applying any activtiy, it is assumed that:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>a plan has been created and given a unique identifier (the
          identifier is not the name of the plan; it is universally unique and

      <title>Plan editor panels</title>

      <para>The Plan editor opens on the development version of one of the
      Plans for which the user has planning privileges.</para>

      <para>When the Plan Editor opens up on a Plan, Channels pre-selects a
      segment and a task within it. The task with its “receive” and “send”
      information flows are shown “collapsed” and summarized.</para>

      <para>A planner can at any time select to see another version of the
      Plan, if any. A planner can also switch to another assigned Plan. Only
      the development version of a Plan can be modified; retired and
      production versions are “read-only” (all form fields are disabled, no
      survey can be launched).</para>

      <para>A planner can at any time select which segment within a Plan to
      view or work on. The tasks and information flows of the selected segment
      are visualized as a flow map (a directed graph). The selected task is
      highlighted (by a gray outlined rectangle) in the flow map.</para>

      <para>The Plan editor window has four principal panels:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>

        <para>The Plan and Segment bar identifies the currently selected
        segment within the currently edited Plan. If applicable, drop down
        menus give the planner access to other versions of the Plan, to other
        Plans, and to others segments within the current Plan.</para>

        <para>The Help icon opens a Help window with this content.</para>

        <para>The Left and righ arrow buttons are Channels' "back and forward"
        buttons. They are to be used instead of the browser's back and forward
        button which take users out of Channels.</para>

        <para>Clicking on the name of the segment (upper left corner) opens up
        the "About segment" panel where the name, description and definition
        of the segment can be edited.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Information flow map</title>

        <para>Tasks are the nodes (icons over text) in the graph and the
        information needs, capabilities and sharing flows are the
        arrows.</para>

        <para>Tasks and flows are drawn in red if they have known issues.
        Green and red traffic lights represent the start and end of the event
        phase covered by the segment. Tasks that are triggered by the start of
        the segment are connected to the green traffic light icon. Tasks that
        terminate the event phase are linked to the red traffic light.</para>

        <para>Information flows (information shared), information needs
        (information needed for carrying out a task) and information
        capabilities (shareable information produced by carrying out a task)
        are shown as arrows. Single-headed arrows represent notifications.
        Double-headed arrows are requests, with the empty arrow head pointing
        to the task that consumes the information request, and with the full
        arrow head pointing to the task that consumes the answer (the
        requested information flows to it).</para>

        <para>Small squares indicate to-be-determined tasks. An arrow from a
        task to a dot represents an information capability of the task
        (information produced by the task that can be shared for use in other
        tasks). An arrow from a small square to a task represents an
        information need of the task (the task needs information possibly
        produced by other tasks).</para>

        <para>When risks and goals are shown in a flow map they appear
        respectively as colored flags and stars connected to tasks and segment
        start and end icons.</para>

        <para>Tasks within a blue rectangle denote tasks from other segments
        that are connected by sharing flows to tasks in the selected
        segment.</para>

        <para>A flow map legend can be shown by clicking on the "help" icon in
        a flow map.</para>

        <title>Task and flow panels</title>

        <para>The task and flow panels at the bottom of the Plan editor show
        summaries of the selected task (there is always a task selected)
        together with a list of summaries of its "receives"( the task's
        information needs and information flows to it) and a list of its
        "sends" (the task's information capabilities and information flows
        from it). Each summary can be expanded into a form.</para>

        <para>Each of the summaries is prefixed with a colored bullet. The
        color of the bullet indicates how important a task or a flow is. The
        color indicates the calculated impact of the task or the flow failing
        completely. Blue indicates a minor impact, yellow is major, orange is
        severe and red is extreme.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Collaboration panel</title>

        <para>The collapsible "collaboration" panel on the right side lets a
        planner see who else is working on the Plan and what they have done
        (their activities). A planner can send messages to a planner or to all
        and can read received messages. The collaboration panel can be
        collapsed if more screen space for the flow map and task/flow forms is
        needed.</para>

        <title>Display controls</title>

        <para>The Plan editor gives the planner some control over the display
        of flow maps, forms used to specify tasks, flows, entities etc., and
        of the collaboration panel.</para>

        <para>Flow maps can be quite large. A flow map can reduced to fit
        within the available space by clicking on the zoom-out icon. Clicking
        on the icon once more brings the flow map back to its normal

        and how they relate to tasks or the segment as a whole. To display
        risks and gains, the planner must click on the "goals" icon. Clicking
        again hides the goals.</para>

      <para>Clicking on a summary for a task opens up a form with which to
      edit the task specifications. Note that the fields of the form are
      disabled if someone else is currently editing the same task. The listed
      “sends” of the task (information shared by the task plus its information
      capabilities) and “receives” (information shared with the task plus its
      information needs) can also be edited by clicking on the summaries to
      open up their respective forms.</para>

      <para>Note that, with very few exceptions, any and all fields in any
      form in Channels can be left blank.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Editing a task</title>

        <para>A task is specified first by naming it and then by categorizing
        it. It is further specified by stating where it is to be executed, by
        whom, in what role, for what jurisdiction, and on behalf of what
        organization. Any of the location, agent, jurisdiction, role, and
        organization (entities) that specify a task can be left unnamed so as
        to imply that more than one agent can be assigned to the task. The
        names of entities can refer to actual entities (Morritown, NJ, John
        Doe, ACME etc.) or to types of entities (a city, a certified
        technician, a corporation etc.).</para>

        <para>The execution of a task can be set to be “as a team” to indicate
        that all assignees are to work together when carrying out the task. By
        default, assignees are each to execute the task independently.</para>

        <para>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to
        complete, whether it repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts
        automatically with the segment (implying that the assigned agents
        would become aware of the onset of the event phase on their
        own).</para>

        <para>The purpose of a task can be stated as terminating the event
        phase of the segment, mitigating one or more risks or achieve gains
        within the segment's scope.</para>

        <para>Related reference and policy documents can be attached to the
        task either by URL or by uploading them. Finally, the task can be
        given a brief, informal description.</para>

        <para>As with any Plan elements, a planner can add issues to those
        automatically detected about the task. Issues added by a planner can
        be removed by any planner.</para>

        <title>Editing a "send" or "receive"</title>

        <para>The information needed, produced or to be shared is named, its
        intent is identified and its elements are enumerated.</para>

        <para>The mode of communication is given as either notification or
        by-request (push or pull).</para>

        <para>Planners can specify if the flow is conditional to the task
        failure if the flow is a requested "receive" (need or received
        sharing) or if it is a "notification send".</para>

        <para>If an information flow (information that's shared) is a
        notification, then it can be made a broadcast (information will be
        shared with all agents assigned to the target task) or a unicast
        (information will be shared with at least one agent assigned to the
        target task).</para>

        <para>Keep in mind that an information flow that is a “send” to a task
        producing shared information is the same information flow that is a
        ”receive” to the task consuming the shared information. One is looking
        at one flow from its two ends.</para>

        <para>An information flow is created by first adding an information
        need to a task (if necessary), then adding an information capability
        of the same name in another (also if necessary), and then connecting
        the need to the capability or vice-versa by setting the “from” or “to”
        field to the other task.</para>

        <para>When specifying or determining the source or target of a flow, a
        planner can restrict the sources and targets to be within the same
        overall organization, within the same organization or within the same
        location. Adding a restriction on a sharing flow may filter out
        sharing commitments that would otherwise be implied by the flow (e.g.
        by dropping any sharing commitment that crosses organizational
        boundaries).</para>

        <para>A communication delay is set either to zero (communication is to
        happen without delay) or to some finite time interval. For an
        information need, the delay represents the timeliness requirement for
        being notified or for getting a response to a request. For an
        information capability, the delay represents how quickly the
        information could be produced and communicated. For a sharing flow,
        the delay represents a “quality of service” commitment.</para>

        <para>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
        can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
        information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
        is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
        that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
        listed in order of preference.</para>

        <para>When editing a “send” or “receive”, a planner can set whether
        sharing would normally trigger or terminate a task. A notification
        could trigger or terminate the receiving task. It could also terminate
        the sending task, if sending the notification concludes the task that
        produced the information. A request could trigger the task that
        produces the requested response.</para>

        <para>Planners can attach documents to a “send” or “receive”. A
        document can be a reference (it documents), a mandating policy (it
        obligates sharing), a prohibiting policy (it prohibits sharing), a
        multiple policy (contains language that imposes obligations and
        restrictions) or it can be an image provided as an illustration (for
        example, a screenshot). If an information flow has a prohibiting
        policy attached to it then there can not be any implied sharing
        commitment.</para>

        <para>Information needed, shareable or to-be shared can be decomposed
        into named elements. Each element of information can bedescribed and
        assigned individual secrecy classifications and handling instructions.
        Planners can indicate whether an element shareable or to be shared is
        related to a received element of information and how.</para>

        <para>An element is implicitly the same as one received (identically
        named element within identically named information received by and
        sent from a given task). If an element sent is the same as one
        received but have different names or compose information with
        different name, then Planners need to indicate that the element sent
        renames the element received. If an element sent is a
        compilation/summation of multiple elements received, Planners can
        identify the received elements that are aggregated into a sent
        element. Doing so enables Channels to track the planned dissemination
        of information.</para>

        <para>To reduce the drudgery of defining elements of information, the
        list can be auto-populated by clicking on the magic wand icon.
        Clicking on the classifications "link" icon forces all elements to
        have the same classification. Clicking again removes the
        constraint.</para>

      top-most “Show” menu.</para>

      <para>The segment is further defined by identifying and describing a set
      of goals of organizations that relate to the segment's event phase.
      Goals can be risks to be mitigated or gains to be achieved. These goals
      are expected to be realized by tasks in the segment. A segment is
      expected to list at least one goal.</para>

      <para>Risks can indirectly be curtailed by tasks that terminate the
      event phase. To be considered useful, tasks that do not curtail nor
      mitigate a risk or do not make gains are expected to at least provide
      information that is directly or indirectly needed by tasks that
      do.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>Goals view</emphasis> of a segment lets planners
      define the goals of organizations that are in scope. Goals can be added
      and removed. A goal is for an organization either to mitigate a risk or
      to make a gain. A goal is given a type (picked from a taxonomy of risks
      or gains), an importance (minor, major, severe for risks, low, medium or
      high for gains), the identity of the organization (either an actual
      organization or a type of organization), and whether the goal goes away
      when the event phase covered by the segment terminates.</para>

      <para>The tasks that mitigate a given risk or achieve a goal in scope
      can be listed, sorted and navigated to.</para>

      <title>Entities</title>

      <para>A new entity (an agent, role, organization, place, event, phase or
      transmission medium) is automatically created when it is first
      referenced by name. Channels requires that all entities of a given kind
      be assigned unique names (John Smith, John Smith (1), John Smith (2)
      etc.).</para>

      <para>Recall that the definitions of Plan elements can reference both
      actual entities (ACME Corporation, Peter Sanchez, Morristown NJ) and
      types of entities (a corporation, a certified emergency technician, a
      city). An entity is classified by tagging it with the names of entity
      types. An entity can only be tagged with entity types of its own kind
      (Warehouse A can be tagged as a building but not as a senior executive).
      Both actual entities and entity types can be edited.</para>

      <para>An editable profile of an entity , actual or type, can be opened
      from wherever the entity is referenced by name, be it in the
      specification of a task, the definition of a segment, or in an aggregate
      or analytical view.</para>

      <para>Keep in mind that events, roles and transmission media in a Plan
      are always types. There is no actual event in a Plan because events are
      always anticipated. There is no such thing as an “actual role” because
      roles are always concepts. Transmission media are also always types
      because a Plan only cares about the class of a transmission
      medium.</para>

      <para>The <emphasis>Details view</emphasis> shows the profile of an
      entity. All entity profiles, whether they are actual or types are
      composed of:</para>

      <para>In addition, an entity profile always includes an index of all
      references to the entity (and matches, if the entity is a type), a list
      of all issues about the entity proper, and a filterable collection of
      all entities that releate to the entity.</para>

        <title>Profiling an organization</title>

        <para>A planner profiling an actual organization can define its
        mission and set its location, contact information, and parent
        organization.</para>

        <para>A planner can declare that it is an issue if a sharing
        commitment by the organization with another is not covered by an
        agreement, and that it is also an issue if there is a role assigned by
        the organization in the Plan for which no agent is known.</para>

        <para>A planner can add entries to an organization's
        membership/employment roster, by naming for each entry an agent, a
        role, a jurisdiction (optional), a title and a supervisor agent
        (optional). Alternately, the planner can confirm memberships that are
        already implied by task specifications (a task specification can
        identify an agent in a role within a jurisdiction for an
        organization).</para>

        <para>Inter-organizational sharing commitments are inferred from
        information flows that are sourced from tasks assignable to members of
        the organization. A sharing agreement may or may not exist for a
        sharing commitment that crosses organizational boundaries. It is an
        issue if an inter-organizational sharing commitment is unconfirmed as
        required by the organization. When viewing an organization, a planner
        can see the sharing commitments the organization makes with other
        organizations and confirm whether each commitment is covered or not by
        an agreement.</para>

        <para>When editing a transmission medium, a planner can set the
        transmission mode to either unicast (one -to-one), multicast
        (one-to-many) or broadcast (one-to-any), unless the mode is already
        implied by another medium this one is tagged with (to make it a
        special case of it).</para>

        <para>The address pattern is a “regular expression” that constrains
        the form an “address” can take for this medium. An empty pattern
        imposes no constraint.</para>

        <para>A planner can identify the media, if any, this one can interface
        with as it carries out transmissions from sender to receiver.</para>

        <para>Finally, a planner can describe the security of the transmission
        medium in terms of security classifications. Qualifying a medium as
        “US Gov/Top Secret” means that Top Secret information can be

        before an event (pre-event), during an event (co-event) or after an
        event (post-event).</para>

        <para>The <emphasis>Network view</emphasis> is available on agents,
        roles, and organizations. It displays a network graph depicting how
        the entity is connected by information flows to other entities of the
        same kind via sharing commitments. This analytical view allows a
        planner to filter commitment-generating information flows to, say,
        show only the ones from tasks executed by a specific role. The network
        graph is navigable. The list of flows can be further filtered, sorted
        and paged. Listed flows can also be navigated to.</para>

      <title>Acquiring and releasing edit locks</title>

      <para>More than one planner can concurrently work on a Plan.
      "Collisions", where two planners are attempting to modify the same Plan
      element at once, are prevented by only allowing one planner at a time to
      modify any given task, flow or entity.</para>

      <para>When a planner opens an edit form on a task etc., Channels
      attempts to grab an edit lock on behalf of the planner for task. If
      another planner already owns the lock, the form is shown to the first
      planner with the editable fields disabled.</para>

      <para>A lock on a task, flow or entity owned by a planner is released
      when the planner collapses or closes its edit form, or logs out. An
      inactive planner eventually loses all acquired locks.</para>

      <para>The name of the owner of a lock appears to other planners usually
      in the place of the "actions" menu. A message can be sent to the owner
      of a lock by clicking on his/her name.</para>

      <title>Viewing task assignments and sharing commitments</title>

      <para>Recall that tasks are defined in terms of agents, roles, places,
      and organizations, and that these entities can be actual or types. A
      task specification may reference entity types or omit to identify by
      name an actual agent, role, jurisdiction, etc. so as to encompass more
      than one possible agent as executor of the task. A task thus defined
      could be assigned to more than one agent.</para>

      <para>A planner can look up the list of known agents that are implicitly
      or explicitly assigned to the task (the task assignments).</para>

      <title>Assessing the impacts of failure</title>

      <para>Planners can visualize what might happen should an agent fail
      completely at an assigned task or should a commitment to share
      information be broken. The consequences could be a number of
      “downstream” tasks failing leading to gains unachieved or risks
      unmitigated.</para>

      <screenshot>
        <info>
          <title>Accessing failure impacts</title>
        </info>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="quick_tour/tour_60.png"></imagedata>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always
      complete; a failed task does not produce any information that may be
      required by others, and a failed information flow does not transfer any
      information whatsoever.</para>

      <para>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly
      or indirectly depend critically on or are triggered by information that
      fails to be produced or to be shared.</para>

      <para>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not
      critical to a task or does not trigger it, then its failure does not
      propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if the target of a flow can get
      the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the flow's
      failure does not matter. Finally, if information produced by an agent is
      necessarily consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure to share
      is meaningless.</para>

      <para>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful
      tasks, that is, tasks that either achieve stated goals or produce
      information that triggers or is critical to other tasks that are
      themselves useful. (Useless tasks are flagged as issues.) Note that a
      task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end (or, more to
      the point, if it causes the event phase the segment is about to end) and
      if the risk is said to terminate with the segment.</para>

      <para>A planner does “what-if”, failure analysis by selecting a task or
      by selecting an information flow (“send” or “receive”) and then looking
      at the consequences should it fail. The planner can take a pessimistic
      outlook and assume that all redundant information flows would also fail,
      no matter what.</para>

      <para>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized as
      a directed graph of information flows, tasks, gains and risks. Risks
      that would otherwise be mitigated or terminated by failed tasks are
      shown as color-coded flags. Orange is for severe risks, yellow for major
      risks and blue for minor risks. Risks that would normally be mitigated
      by successful tasks are shown connected to these tasks. Risks that would
      be terminated, should a segment end, are shown connected to red stop
      lights. Each stop light is itself connected to a failed task that would
      normally end the segment.</para>

      <para>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by
      importance, with orange for high, yellow for medium and blue for
      low.</para>

      <para>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed,
      goal-oriented tasks (the failures that matter) is compiled and
      presented. The table is paginated and the columns (failing task,
      segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization impacted)
      can be sorted.</para>

      <para>Failure analysis crosses segment boundaries. A failed task in one
      segment can cause tasks to fail in other segments. Tasks, flows and
      goals in segments other than the selected segment are put in blue boxes
      representing the other segments.</para>

      <title>Tracking planned information dissemination</title>

      <para>If planners systematically identify the non-implied relationships
      between received and sent elements of informations, then Channels can
      track the planned dissemination of individual elements of information.
      Dissemination tracking can be done forward (where does the element go?)
      and backward (where does the element come from?).</para>

      <para>Dissemination tracking can be accessed from a part (offering a
      choice of all elements received or sent by the task) or it can be
      accessed from a flow (restricting the choice to the elements to those in
      the flow). Dissemination tracking from a part gives the option of
      looking at sources as wel as targets of individual elements of
      information. A receive flow only tracks sources and a send fow only
      tracks targets.</para>

      <title>Actions</title>

      <para>Planners can create and remove segments; add, cut, copy and paste
      tasks, needs, capabilities and flows, connect tasks with information
      flows, disconnect them, add an issue, remove a segment, move tasks
      across segments, add an intermediate to a flow etc. Relevant actions are
      all available from “action” menus within the context of a plan, segment,
      task, flow or entity.</para>

      <para>Some actions have simple effects (adding a task, for example) but
      others can be more complex:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>“disintermediate” removes a task that acts as a middleman in a
          flow</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>“satisfy needs” automatically connects information needs of a
          task to matching but untapped information capabilities from other

        <listitem>
          <para>"move tasks" moves one or more tasks from one segment to
          another, possibly also adding goals achieved by the moved tasks to
          the target segment.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>All actions are implementd in Channels as "commands". Most
      commands are reversible and can be undone and redone up and until some
      planner takes an action that would conflict with the undoing or redoing
      (for example, removing a task prevents undoing a change to one of its
      attributes). The execution of each command is journaled for replay
      should the server be interrupted and restarted. It is also recorded and
      listed in the activities tab in the collaboration panel.</para>

      <title>Adding and scoping a segment</title>

      <para>When a planner creates a new segment, it is given a default name
      and scope. Planners can change the name and modify the segment's scope
      (the event, phase and goals it addresses).</para>

      <para>A planner would typically first name and describe the segment, set
      its scope by identifying an event, setting a threshold rating for the
      event, naming the phase of the event, and listing goals to be achieved).
      Then the planner would specify the lone task automatically added upon
      creating the segment. Then, additional tasks would be added, together
      with their information needs and capabilities. These tasks would be
      connected via information flows with other tasks in the selected segment
      or other segments.</para>

      <para>There may come a point when a segment becomes too large (it has
      too many tasks and flows) to remain manageable. Planners will typically
      decide to create a new segment and to move a number of tasks, and
      attendant flows, from the oversized segment to the new segment. Usually,
      the tasks moved are those that directly or indirectly achieve a goal
      that will now be within the scope of the new segment. Note that if a
      goal achieved by a moved task is not in the scope of the destination
      segement, it is added to it.</para>

      <title>Issue detection and management</title>

      <para>Channels automatically detects more than 70 different kinds of
      issues. Planners can manually add issues to Plan elements, describe
      these issues and suggest remediations. Manually added issues can later
      be removed.</para>

      <para>Issue detection and remediation can guide planners as to what to
      do next when building, fixing and improving a Plan. For example, a newly
      created segment with its lone task will immediately cause the detection
      of incompleteness issues. Resolving these incompleteness issues drives
      the planning process forward.</para>

      <para>Some detected issues can be waived by planners if they are
      considered not to apply in a particular case. Note that when waiving an
      issue of a certain kind about a Plan element, all issues of this kind
      are also waived for that same element.</para>

      <title>Connecting tasks with sharing flows</title>

      <para>After adding a task, a planner may want to give it one or more
      information needs, and, for each need, name the information required and
      list the elements of information.</para>

      <para>When a planner names an information, Channels suggests a list of
      already used information names that look like or mean something similar
      to the name being entered. This “semantic proximity”-based, auto-suggest
      capability leverages the WordNet lexical database and is available
      throughout Channels.</para>

      <para>A planner may want to add an information capability to a task
      (shareable information produced by the specified task) and then connect
      it to a matching information need from another task in the selected
      segment or in another segment.</para>

      <para>Connecting a capability with a need is done by selecting a task
      with a matching need from the “From” drop-down menu in the flow form
      (and vice-versa). When a capability is to be connected to a need, the
      drop-down menu lists all likely candidate tasks. The list of candidates
      consists of all tasks in <emphasis>any</emphasis> segments with matching
      information needs and all tasks in the <emphasis>current</emphasis>
      segment with matching sharing flows. To select an unlisted task within
      the same segment, planners can choose "Other..." and enter the name of
      the task to connect to. When a need is to be connected to a capability,
      the same process is used but, this time, the drop-down list is populated
      with candidate capabilities.</para>

      <para>Connecting a need with a capability creates a new information flow
      but does not remove the connected task' information need.</para>

        <para>Access to an external service requires account identification,
        either in the form of user id and password or in the form of an API
        key. When Channels is used as a service, service configuration is
        already taken care of. However when installing a new instance of
        Channels, an Administrator must provide purchase service access and
        configure Channels to use the correct account information. <footnote>
            <para>The installation and configuration of Channels is covered in
            the "Channels Installation and Configuration Guide".</para>

        <para>Before creating a new Plan, the Administrator normally creates
        two distinct support communities, one for the planners and one for the
        users of the to-be-created Plan. The administrator creates BetaEasy
        accounts for all planners and sends out login information to
        them.</para>

        <para>Each support community is implemented as a BetaEasy project. The
        community is identified by a BetaEasy project ID. A default support
        community is pre-defined for all Plans that don't identity their own
        support communities.</para>

        <para>It is the responsibility of the administrator to give each
        planner access to the BetaEasy projects that correspond to the Plans
        they are assigned to. After logging in, the planner can see reports on
        the feedback of other planners and of users. Users provide their
        feedback about their Procedures via the feedback widget from within
        the Information Sharing Procedures report. Planners provide their
        feedback about the Plan from within the Plan editor.</para>

        <para>To browse and mine the feedback of other planners about a Plan
        or of users about their Procedures, a planner must first log into the
        BetaEasy service.</para>

    <title>FAQs</title>

    <section>
      <title>How is ISP different from BPM?</title>

      <para>The most frequently asked question about Information Sharing
      Planning is How does it differ from Business Process Management?</para>

      <para>To answer this question, one must first consider that Information
      Sharing Planning (ISP) is part of something larger called Information
      Sharing Management.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Information Sharing Management</emphasis> (ISM) is a set
      of technologies and best practices that help communities of
      organizations share information more effectively in order to manage
      risks when preparing for, responding to, and recovering from actual
      events. Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces the information
      sharing procedures that organizations apply when doing ISM. ISP analyzes
      these procedures for continuous improvement.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Business Process Management</emphasis> (BPM) helps
      enterprises become more efficient, more effective and more agile in how
      they operate. Business Process Modeling captures and analyzes their
      business processes for continuous improvement.</para>

      <para>Because ISP relates most closely to Business Process Modeling, the
      question should be recast to How does Information Sharing Management
      differ from Business Process Management?</para>

      <para>Other questions are Can ISM and BPM be used together?, and How do
      the markets for BPM and ISM compare?</para>

      <section>
        <title>Differences</title>

        <para>BPM and ISM tackle different problems from different
        perspectives.</para>

        <para>BPM focuses 'inward' on a single (but possibly extended)
        enterprise. It looks at how the enterprise responds internally to
        events, and at how it renders services to its customers. The end is
        maximizing value creation while minimizing costs. The means is
        business process improvement.</para>

        <para>ISM focuses 'outward' on (often ad hoc) communities of
        organizations. It looks at how organizations depend on one another to
        get the information they need to execute tasks that achieve
        organizational goals. The end is minimizing the impacts of systemic
        risks and maximizing the capture of opportunities. The means is better
        information sharing procedures.</para>

        <para>While there is conceptual overlap (both ISM and BPM involve
        tasks, events and communications) and even though they both use
        somewhat similar-looking visualizations (directed graphs), ISM and BPM
        have very different world views. BPM looks at the operations of an
        enterprise, whereas ISM looks at the information flows within a
        community of organizations. They also differ in their goals. BPM
        optimizes enterprise value creation whereas ISM reduces the impacts of
        systemic risks.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Similarities</title>

        <para>ISM and BPM are structurally similar in a number of ways.</para>

        <para>Both BPM and ISM are concerned with optimization. BPM optimizes
        the design and execution of business processes, whereas ISM optimizes
        information sharing procedures and their application.</para>

        <para>BPM and ISM each has a modeling component (business process
        modeling, information sharing planning) and a deployment component
        (modeled business processed are deployed as work flows, information
        sharing plans are deployed as information sharing procedures).</para>

        <para>Both BPM and ISM integrate with existing systems and
        technologies. BPM integrates with EAI (Enterprise Application
        Integration), SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and EBA (Event-Based
        Architecture) technologies. ISM integrates primarily with
        Communication Technologies, Enterprise Directories and SOA.</para>

        <para>Finally, both BPM and ISM require the participation of analysts.
        BPM involves 'business process engineers' and ISM involves
        'information sharing planners'.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Integration</title>

        <para>Because BPM and ISM have such different world views, we should
        not expect either to eventually absorb the other.</para>

        <para>There are however significant points of interaction between BPM
        and ISM. To name a few, business processes can be driven by events
        that become known through information sharing, and the business
        processes executed when carrying out risk-mitigating tasks can be
        optimized.</para>

        <para>It is reasonable to assume that BPM and ISM products will, in
        some future, work together to their mutual benefit.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Markets</title>

        <para>“The BPM market is one of the fastest growing software markets,
        estimated to grow tenfold in five years, from approximately US$500
        million in 2006 to US$6 billion in 2011.” <footnote>
            <para>See
            <uri>http://www.oracle.com/technologies/bpm/docs/state-of-bpm-market-whitepaper.pdf</uri></para>
          </footnote></para>

        <para>While BPM is a maturing field, ISM is still in its infancy. It
        is too early to attempt an estimate of how fast the market for ISM
        could grow or how big it could ultimately become.</para>

        <para>However, ISM is applicable to all domains of joint human
        endeavor, from emergency response to business risk management. With
        the explosive growth in systemic risks, as underscored by the recent
        financial crisis, the value proposition of ISM in an increasingly
        inter-connected world is bound to become compelling.</para>

        <para>As BPM products become consolidated among a small number of
        large vendors, ISM may represent a unique opportunity for small firms
        to enter and define a new market space. Established BPM vendors might
        also want to offer BPMintegrated ISM products in order to
        differentiate themselves from their competitors.</para>
