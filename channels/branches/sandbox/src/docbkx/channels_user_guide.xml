    <title>Motivation and definitions</title>

    <para>Organizations operate in an increasingly inter-connected and
    inter-dependent world. Systemic risks are growing. Organizations must
    network to compete in a global marketplace. They can no longer respond to
    major crisis nor can they seize global business opportunities on their
    own. Success now largely depends on the timely and targeted sharing of
    information within and between organizations.</para>

    <para>During a crisis, information will not spontaneously flow as needed.
    Maintaining contact lists is not enough; organizations must plan ahead and
    create actionable information sharing procedures.</para>

    <para>Information Sharing Planning provides a framework and method for
    designing and improving the information sharing procedures required to
    successfully manage systemic risks and seize opportunities.</para>

    <section>
      <title>In a nutshell</title>

      <para><emphasis>Information Sharing Planning captures, analyzes and
      deploys knowledge of how organizations need to share information to
      mitigate systemic risks and seize opportunities from anticipated
      events.</emphasis></para>

      <para>Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces information sharing
      procedures for event preparedness, response and recovery. Information
      Sharing Plans capture commitments to share the information required for
      organizations to fulfill their missions.</para>

      <para>ISP uncovers:</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The deliverables of ISP are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>documented information sharing procedures</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>detected information sharing gaps, bottlenecks and single
          points of failure.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It is important understand that an Information Sharing Plan is not
      an action plan. Its objective is not to dictate a sequence of actions.
      Information sharing planning concerns itself exclusively with capturing
      the information sharing required according to circumstance so that
      necessary tasks can be carried out successfully.</para>

      <para>However, task sequencing is not entirely absent from ISP. A task
      may require information produced by another task that would then
      necessarily precede it. These sequencing constraints do not typically
      apply to all tasks and they certainly do not dictate a unique ordering
      for all tasks. In any case, attempting to define an action plan for
      organizations that don't have a central authority is more often than not
      an exercise in futility. What really matters here is capturing what
      needs to be done, what information is required and produced, and how and
      when it should or should not be shared.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Definitions</title>

      <para>An <glossterm>Information Sharing Plan</glossterm> captures the
      information sharing procedures that people and systems in roles of
      responsibility are expected to apply in order to fulfill the missions of
      their organizations before, during and/or after certain types of events.
      A Plan is comprised of tasks and information flows. Tasks manage risks,
      achieve gains and/or contribute information to other tasks. Information
      flows connect tasks that produce information with tasks that require
      it.</para>

      <para>An Information Sharing Plan can be abstracted from a specific
      context (a context is a collection of organizations with people and
      systems in their employ) so as to make the Plan generally
      applicable.</para>

      <para>An <glossterm>event</glossterm> in ISP is something that happens
      or has happened somewhere and that introduces risks to organizations or
      to their missions.</para>

      <para>A <glossterm>goal</glossterm> is either a risk or a gain. A goal
      is associated with the pre-, co- or post- event phase of an anticipated
      event. A <glossterm>risk</glossterm> is a possible, negative outcome and
      it is categorized according to an actuarial taxonomy of risks, and it is
      rated as more or less severe. A <glossterm>gain</glossterm> is the flip
      side of a risk. It is a possible positive outcome, and it is categorized
      by a taxonomy that mirrors the risk taxonomy. A gain is rated as either
      low, medium or high.</para>

      <para>A goal is either a risk or a gain. A goal is associated with the
      pre-, co- or post- event phase of an anticipated event. A risk is a
      possible, negative outcome and it is categorized according to an
      actuarial taxonomy of risks, and it is rated as more or less severe. A
      gain is the flip side of a risk. It is a possible positive outcome, and
      it is categorized by a taxonomy that mirrors the risk taxonomy. A gain
      is rated as either low, medium or high.</para>

      <para>Information sharing plans will typically deal with more than one
      phase of more that one type of event. Because plans can become quite
      large, planners break them into smaller, more manageable units of
      planning called segments.</para>

      <para>An information sharing <glossterm>segment</glossterm> covers one
      phase of one type of event, and it will typically focus on just a few
      goals of organizations. Segments usually depend on other segments. Two
      segments are co-dependent when information produced by a task in one
      segment is consumed by a task in the other, or when a task in one
      segment initiates the event phase covered by the other segment.</para>

      <para>Segments are planning artifacts. They are not meaningful to
      non-planners. An information sharing playbook ignores segment boundaries
      when aggregating a person or system's task assignments and sharing
      commitments.</para>

      <para>A <glossterm>task</glossterm> in ISP describes something done
      somewhere for some purpose by a person or system in a role of
      responsibility on behalf of an organization. The people or systems
      carrying out tasks are profiled by name, role, jurisdiction and/or
      organization. The executor of a task may be profiled only partially so
      that more than one person or system match the profile and get assigned
      to the task. According to a tasks' definition, those assigned to the
      task are expected to carry it out either as a team or on their
      own.</para>

      <para>Tasks are considered useful if they:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>achieve risk mitigation or gains,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>initiate or terminate (phases of) events,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>or produce information needed by other useful tasks.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Tasks can be triggered or terminated by:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>awareness of events,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>requests for information they receive.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para><glossterm>Information flows</glossterm> link tasks that produce
      information to tasks that consume it. A flow is characterized by:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the information communicated (down to its elements, each with
          optional secrecy classifications and optional sourcing and handling
          instructions),</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the mode of communication (request vs notification, unicast vs
          broadcast),</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>a list of preferred communication media (phone, face-to-face
          etc.),</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the impacts, if any, the communication may have (it might
          trigger or terminate a task),</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>policies that mandate or prohibit sharing.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para><glossterm>Task assignments</glossterm> are determined by matching
      the tasks specified in the Plan with the people and systems profiled in
      a context. People and systems are bound by <glossterm>information
      sharing commitments</glossterm> when they are assigned tasks that
      produce information consumed by other tasks.</para>

      <para>The <glossterm>information sharing procedures</glossterm> captured
      by a Plan are the task assignments plus the information sharing
      commitments of all persons and systems in context.</para>

      <para>An <glossterm>information sharing playbook</glossterm> is the sum
      of all information sharing procedures in a Plan for a given person or
      system.</para>

      <para>Plans, segments, tasks, information needs, capabilities and flows
      are defined in terms of actual or types of agents, places, roles,
      organizations, events, communication media and phases of events. These
      are called entities. An entity in ISP is grab-all concept for something
      not planned that can be unambiguously referenced by name. Entities may
      themselves be defined in terms of other entities (an organization
      assigns roles to the persons it employs and systems it administers,
      etc.).</para>

      <para>Actual entities (“Jane Smith”, “ACME Inc.”, “Morristown, Morris
      County, NJ, USA” etc.) are categorized by types of entities (“Senior
      executive”, “Corporation”, “City” etc.). Entity types can refine other
      entity types (a “Senior executive” is an “Executive”).</para>

      <para>An <glossterm>agent</glossterm> is either a person or an
      information processing system (system for short). A system is capable of
      sending notifications, answering queries, receiving notifications or
      sending queries. An agent has contact information. An agent's clearance
      is a list of secrecy classifications. A secrecy classification has a
      name (“NATO”) and an ordered list of secrecy levels (“Restricted”,
      “Confidential”, “Secret”, “Focal Top Secret”, “Cosmic Top
      Secret”).</para>

      <para>An <glossterm>organization</glossterm> is a group of agents
      organized to accomplish a mission. An organization assigns roles of
      responsibility to the persons and systems that act on its behalf. An
      organization has contact information and may contain other
      organizations. An organization may have information sharing agreements
      with other organizations to formalize the sharing commitments its
      members has with members of other organizations.</para>

      <para>A <glossterm>role</glossterm> is a set of powers and
      responsibilities assigned by an organization to an agent acting on
      behalf of the organization. A role assignment may be restricted to a
      jurisdiction.</para>

      <para>A <glossterm>place</glossterm> is either a geographical area (some
      city, county, state, country, natural preserve etc.) or a known location
      (some train station, building etc.). A place can be contained in another
      (for example, a building can be in a campus). An event and an event type
      can both be scoped to a place.</para>

      <para>A <glossterm>phase</glossterm> names a time period relative to an
      event. A phase of an event is either CONFIDENTIAL - Copyright (C) 2010
      Mind-Alliance Systems. All Rights Reserved. 8 set to before, during or
      after the event. Typical phases are “Preparing”, “Responding” and
      “Recovering”.</para>

      <para>A <glossterm>communication medium</glossterm> is how agents
      transmit information. A medium is either unicast (transmits to a single,
      known agent), multicast (transmits to multiple, known agents) or
      broadcast (little to no control over who receives the transmission).
      Communication media may or may not be technology-based. “Telephone”,
      “Email”, “Instant Messaging” are examples of unicast communication
      media, and so is “Face-to-face”. “Notification system” and “Meeting” are
      both multicast media. “Television”, “Radio” and “PA System” are examples
      of broadcast media. A communication medium can delegate transmissions to
      other media (for example, VoIP can interface with Telephones). The
      security of a medium is expressed in terms of secrecy
      classifications.</para>

      <para>ISP identifies more than 60 different kinds of
      <glossterm>issues</glossterm> about tasks, information flows, entities
      and entire segments and plans. There are issues of validity (definition
      errors), completeness (missing Plan elements) and robustness (something
      that makes the Plan failure-prone). An issue has a description, a list
      of suggested remediations, and a severity level.</para>

    <title>Using Channels</title>

    <section>
      <title>Channels basics</title>

      <para>Channels is a collaborative Web application for building,
      analyzing and deploying Information Sharing Plans.</para>

      <para>Each Information Sharing Plan has one development version (the
      only one that can be modified), possibly one production version (the
      only one participants can access to view their playbooks), and zero or
      more retired versions (prior production versions).</para>

      <section>
        <title>User roles</title>

        <para>Channels recognizes three user roles: administrators, planners
        and Plan participants. Administrators assign planners and participants
        to plans hosted by a Channels instance. Planners jointly develop,
        review and deploy information sharing plans. Participants view their
        playbooks and respond to surveys from planners about issue
        resolutions.</para>

        <para>An administrator can:</para>

        <title>Logging in and selecting a Plan and segment</title>

        <para>When accessing Channels, an unrecognized user is presented with
        a login screen.</para>

        <screenshot>
          <info>
            <title>Login screen</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </screenshot>

        <para>After logging in, a user with planning privileges (a planner)
        accesses the Plan Editor. A participant is directed to his/her
        playbook (see section 3.15). For a planner, the editor opens on the
        development version of an assigned Plan.</para>

        <para>When the Plan Editor is first accessed, Channels pre-selects a
        segment and a task within it. The task with its “receive” and “send”
        information flows are shown “collapsed” and summarized.</para>

        <para>A planner can at any time select to see another version of the
        Plan, if any. A planner can also switch to another assigned Plan. Only
        the development version of a Plan can be modified; retired and
        production versions are “read-only” (all form fields are disabled, no
        survey can be launched).</para>

        <para>A planner can at any time select which segment within a Plan to
        view or work on. The tasks and information flows of the selected
        segment are visualized as a flow map (a directed graph). The selected
        task is highlighted (by a gray rectangle) in the flow map.</para>

        </screenshot>

        <para>Flow maps can be quite large. A planner can maximize a flow map
        to see more of it without needing to scroll. Whether maximized or not,
        a flow map can be zoomed out to fit within the available space.</para>

        <para>Tasks and flows are drawn in red if they have known issues.
        Green and red traffic lights represent the start and end of the event
        phase covered by the segment. Tasks that are triggered by the start of
        the segment are connected to the green traffic light icon. Tasks that
        terminate the event phase are linked to the red traffic light.</para>

        <para>Information flows (information shared), information needs
        (information needed for carrying out a task) and information
        capabilities (shareable information produced by carrying out a task)
        are shown as arrows. Single-headed arrows represent notifications.
        Double-headed arrows are requests, with the empty arrow head pointing
        to the task that consumes the information request, and with the full
        arrow head pointing to the task that consumes the answer (the
        requested information flows to it).</para>

        <para>Dots indicate to-be-determined tasks. An arrow from a task to a
        dot represents an information capability of the task (information
        produced by the task that can be shared for use in other tasks). An
        arrow from a dot to a task represents an information need of the task
        (the task needs information possibly produced by other tasks).</para>

        <para>Tasks with a blue background denote remote tasks, that is, tasks
        from another segment that are connected by sharing flows to tasks in
        the selected segment.</para>

        task (information shared by the task plus its information
        capabilities) and the “receives” of the task (information shared with

        <para>A task is defined by first naming it. It is further defined by
        stating where it is to be executed, by whom, in what role, for what
        jurisdiction, and on behalf of what organization. Any of the location,
        agent, jurisdiction, role, and organization (entities) that specify a
        task can be left unnamed so as to imply that more than one agent can
        be assigned to the task. When the entities are named, the names can
        identify actual entities (Morritown, NJ, John Doe, ACME etc.) or types
        of entities (a city, a certified technician, a corporation
        etc.).</para>

        <para>The execution of a task can be set to be “as a team” to indicate
        that all assignees are to work together when carrying out the task. By
        default, assignees are each to execute the task independently.</para>

        <para>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to
        complete, whether it repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts
        automatically with the segment (implying that the assigned agents
        would become aware of the onset of the event phase on their
        own).</para>

        <para>The purpose of a task can be stated as terminating the event
        phase of the segment, mitigating one or more risks or achieve gains
        within the segment's scope.</para>

        <para>Related reference and policy documents can be attached to the
        task either by URL or by uploading them. Finally, the task can be
        given a brief, informal description.</para>

        <para>When editing a “receive” or a “send”, the information needed,
        produced or to be shared is named and its elements are enumerated, and
        each assigned individual secrecy classifications and optional sourcing
        and handling instructions.</para>

        <para>The mode of communication is given as either notification or
        by-request (push or pull).</para>

        <para>If an information flow (information that's shared) is a
        notification, then it can be made a broadcast (information will be
        shared with all agents assigned to the target task) or a unicast
        (information will be shared with at least one agent assigned to the
        target task).</para>

        <para>Keep in mind that an information flow that is a “send” to a task
        producing shared information is the same information flow that is a
        ”receive” to the task consuming the shared information. One is looking
        at one flow from its two ends.</para>

        <para>An information flow is created by first adding an information
        need to a task (if necessary), then adding an information capability
        of the same name in another (also if necessary), and then connecting
        the need to the capability or vice-versa by setting the “from” or “to”
        field to the other task.</para>

        <para>A communication delay is set either to zero (communication is to
        happen without delay) or to some finite time interval. For an
        information need, the delay represents the timeliness requirement for
        being notified or for getting a response to a request. For an
        information capability, the delay represents how quickly the
        information could be produced and communicated. For a sharing flow,
        the delay represents a “quality of service” commitment.</para>

        <para>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
        can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
        information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
        is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
        that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
        listed in order of preference.</para>

        <para>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
        can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
        information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
        is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
        that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
        listed in order of preference.</para>

        <para>When editing a “send” or “receive”, a planner can set whether
        sharing would normally trigger or terminate a task. A notification
        could trigger or terminate the receiving task. It could also terminate
        the sending task, if sending the notification concludes the task that
        produced the information. A request could trigger the task that
        produces the requested response.</para>

        <para>Planners can attach documents to a “send” or “receive”. A
        document can be a reference (it documents), a mandating policy (it
        obligates sharing), a prohibiting policy (it prohibits sharing), a
        multiple policy (contains language that imposes obligations and
        restrictions) or it can be an image provided as an illustration (for
        example, a screenshot). If an information flow has a prohibiting
        policy attached to it then there can not be any implied sharing
        commitment.</para>

        <para>As with any Plan elements, a planner can add issues to those
        detected about tasks or its “sends” or “receives”. Manually added
        issues can be removed.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Segment scoping</title>

        <para>Planners can edit the scope, name and description of a segment.
        A segment's edit form is accessed by selecting “About segment” from
        the top-most “Show” menu.</para>

        <para>This opens a Details view on the selected segment where it can
        be renamed and where the phase and event it references can be changed.
        As with any other kind of Plan element, reference and policy documents
        can be attached to a segment.</para>

        <para>The scope of a segment is further defined by identifying and
        describing a set of goals of organizations that relate to the
        segment's event phase. Goals can be risks to be mitigated or gains to
        be achieved. These goals are expected to be realized by tasks in the
        segment. Risks can also be curtailed by tasks that terminate the event
        phase. To be considered useful, tasks that do not curtail nor mitigate
        a risk or do not make gains are expected to at least provide
        information that is directly or indirectly needed by tasks that
        do.</para>

        <para>The <emphasis>Goals view</emphasis> of a segment lets planners
        define the goals of organizations that are in scope. Goals can be
        added and removed. A goal is for an organization either to mitigate a
        risk or to make a gain. A goal is given a type (picked from a taxonomy
        of risks or gains), an importance (minor, major, severe for risks,
        low, medium or high for gains), the identity of the organization
        (either an actual organization or a type of organization), and whether
        the goal goes away when the event phase covered by the segment
        terminates.</para>

        <para>The tasks that mitigate a given risk or achieve a goal in scope
        can be listed, sorted and navigated to.</para>

        <title>Editing and analyzing entities</title>

        <para>A new entity (an agent, role, organization, place, event, phase
        or communication medium) is automatically created whenever it is first
        referenced by name. Channels requires that all entities of a given
        kind be assigned unique names (John Smith, John Smith (1), John Smith
        (2) etc.).</para>

        <para>Recall that the definitions of Plan elements can reference
        actual entities (ACME Corporation, Peter Sanchez, Morristown NJ) and
        types of entities (a corporation, a certified emergency technician, a
        city). An entity can only be tagged with entity types of its own kind
        (Warehouse A can be tagged as a building but not as a senior
        executive). Both actual entities and entity types can be edited. An
        editable and analytical view of an actual entity or type of entity can
        be opened from wherever it is referenced.</para>

        <para>Keep in mind that events, roles and communication media in a
        Plan are always types. There is no actual event in a Plan because
        events are always anticipated. There is no such thing as an “actual
        role” because roles are always concepts. Communication media are also
        always types because a Plan only cares about the class of a
        communication medium.</para>

        <para>The <emphasis>Details view</emphasis> of an entity enables a
        planner to change the entity's name, description, and types.</para>

        <para>Each kind of entity has additional, specific attributes that can
        also be set. For example, a planner editing an actual organization can
        define its mission, and set its location, contact information, and
        parent organization. A planner can enforce that any sharing commitment
        by the organization with another be covered by an agreement, and that
        there be at least one known agent for each referenced role assigned by
        the organization. A planner edits the organization's employment roster
        of agents by either confirming employment implied by task in segments
        and assigning titles. A planner can also directly add new employees
        with their titles, roles and jurisdictions.</para>

        <para>Cross-organizational sharing commitments are inferred from
        information flows in the Plan. A sharing agreement may or may not
        exist for a sharing commitment that crosses organizational boundaries.
        An unconfirmed agreement for a cross-organizational sharing commitment
        is an issue if such agreements are required for the organization. When
        viewing an organization, a planner can see the sharing commitments the
        organization makes with other organizations and confirm whether each
        commitment is covered or not by an agreement.</para>

        <para>In the Details view of any kind of entity, references to the
        entity are listed as a filterable and paged index. Issues about the
        entity, if any, are enumerated at the bottom of the view.</para>

        <para>In the Details view of an actual agent (as opposed to a type of
        agent), the agent, if it is a person and not a system, can be related
        to a user. The user, if not a planner, will be able to request to view
        his or her playbook (the agent's playbook) from the production version
        of the Plan. The agent can be declared to be a person or system, and
        given contact information (communication media with addresses where
        applicable) as well as clearances (secrecy classifications).</para>

        <para>When editing a place from within the Details view, a planner can
        identify what other place, if any, contains it. A planner can also
        give the place a street address, postal code and a geoname. If the
        geoname is ambiguous, more specific geonames are offered for
        selection.</para>

        <para>When editing a communication medium, a planner can set the
        transmission mode to either unicast (one -to-one), multicast
        (one-to-many) or broadcast (one-to-any), unless the mode is already
        implied by another medium this one is tagged with (to make it a
        special case of the tagging medium). The address pattern is a “regular
        expression”1 that constrains the form an “address” can take for this
        medium. A planner can identify the media, if any, this one interfaces
        with as it carries out transmissions from sender to receiver. Here
        again, some of the interfaced media might be implied from another
        medium this one is tagged with. Finally, a planner can describe the
        security of the communication medium in terms of security
        classifications. Qualifying a medium as “US Gov/Top Secret” means that
        Top Secret information can be transmitted securely over this
        medium.</para>

        same kind. This analytical view allows a planner to filter the
        information flows to, say, show only the ones from tasks executed by a
        specific role. The network graph is navigable. The list of flows can
        be further filtered, sorted and paged. Listed flows can also be

        <title>Acquiring and releasing edit locks</title>

        <para>More than one planner can concurrently work on a Plan. To
        prevent “collisions” where two planners are attempting to modify the
        same Plan element at the same time, only one planner is permitted to
        modify any given task, flow or entity at a time.</para>

        <para>When a planner opens an edit form on a Plan element, Channels
        attempts to grab an edit lock on behalf of the planner for that Plan
        element. If another planner already owns the lock, the form is shown
        to the first planner with the editable fields disabled.</para>

        <para>A lock on a task, flow or entity owned by a planner is released
        when the planner collapses or closes its edit form. An inactive or

        task specification may reference entity types or omit to identify by

        <title>Assessing the impacts of failure</title>

        <para>Planners can assess what might happen should someone fail at an
        assigned task or should a commitment to share information be broken.
        The consequences could be a number of “downstream” tasks failing to
        make gains or mitigate or eliminate risks as planned.</para>

            <title>Accessing failure impacts</title>
          </info>

        <para>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always
        complete; a failed task does not produce any information that may be
        required by others, and a failed information flow does not transfer
        any information whatsoever.</para>

        <para>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly
        or indirectly depend critically on or are triggered by information
        that fails to be produced or to be shared.</para>

        <para>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not
        critical to a task or does not trigger it, then its failure does not
        propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if the target of a flow can get
        the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the flow's
        failure does not matter. Finally, if information produced by an agent
        is necessarily consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure to
        share is meaningless.</para>

        <para>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful
        tasks, that is, tasks that either achieve stated goals or produce
        information that triggers or is critical to other tasks that are
        themselves useful. (Useless tasks are flagged as issues.) Note that a
        task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end (or, more to
        the point, if it causes the event phase the segment is about to end)
        and if the risk is said to terminate with the segment.</para>

        <para>A planner does “what-if”, failure analysis by selecting a task
        or by selecting an information flow (“send” or “receive”) and then
        looking at the consequences should it fail. The planner can take a
        pessimistic outlook and assume that all redundant information flows
        would also fail, no matter what.</para>

        <para>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized
        as a directed graph of information flows, tasks, gains and risks.
        Risks that would otherwise be mitigated or terminated by failed tasks
        are shown as color-coded flags. Orange is for severe risks, yellow for
        major risks and blue for minor risks. Risks that would normally be
        mitigated by successful tasks are shown connected to these tasks.
        Risks that would be terminated, should a segment end, are shown
        connected to red stop lights. Each stop light is itself connected to a
        failed task that would normally end the segment.</para>

        <para>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by
        importance, with orange for high, yellow for medium and blue for
        low.</para>

        <para>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed,
        goal-oriented tasks (the failures that matter) is compiled and
        presented. The table is paginated and the columns (failing task,
        segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization
        impacted) can be sorted.</para>

        <para>Failure analysis crosses segment boundaries. A failed task in
        one segment can cause tasks to fail in other segments. Tasks, flows
        and goals in segments other than the selected segment are grouped in
        blue boxes.</para>

        <title>Actions</title>

        <para>Planners can create and remove segments; add, cut, copy and
        paste tasks, needs, capabilities and flows, connect tasks together
        with information flows or disconnect them. These actions are all
        available from “action” menus associated with editable Plan
        elements.</para>

        <para>High-level actions can also be taken whenever applicable. They
        include “disintermediate” which removes a task that acts as a
        middleman in a flow, “intermediate” which adds a middleman task to a
        flow, and “satisfy needs” which automatically connects information
        needs of a task to matching but untapped information capabilities from
        other tasks.</para>

        <para>Most actions can be undone and redone up and until a planner
        takes an action that conflicts with the undoing or redoing.</para>

        with their information needs and capabilities. These tasks would be
        connected via information flows with other tasks in the selected
        segment or other segments.</para>

        <title>Issue detection and management</title>

        <para>Channels automatically detects more than 60 different kinds of
        issues. Planners can manually add issues to Plan elements, describe
        these issues and suggest remediations. Manually added issues can later
        be removed.</para>

        <para>Issue detection and remediation can provide guidance to planners
        as to what to do next when building a Plan. For example, a newly
        created segment with its lone task will immediately cause the
        detection of incompleteness issues. Resolving these incompleteness
        issues drives the planning process forward.</para>

        <para>Some detected issues can be waived by planners if they are
        considered moot. When waiving an issue of a certain kind about a Plan
        element, all issues of this kind are also waived for the same
        element.</para>

        <title>Connecting tasks with sharing flows</title>

        <para>After adding a task, a planner may want to give it one or more

        and list the elements of information.</para>

        <para>When a planner names an information, Channels suggests a list of
        already used information names that look like or mean something
        similar to the name being entered. This “semantic proximity”-based,
        auto-suggest capability leverages the WordNet lexical database and is
        available throughout Channels.</para>

        <para>A planner may want to add an information capability to a task
        (shareable information produced by the specified task) and then
        connect it to a matching information need from another task in the
        selected segment or in another segment.</para>

        <para>Connecting a capability with a need is done by selecting a task
        with a matching need from the “From” drop-down menu in the flow form
        (and vice-versa). Connecting a need with a capability creates a new
        information flow but does not remove the connected tasks' capability
        and need.</para>

        <para>Information classification, the security of communications and
        the clearances of agents can be important elements of information
        sharing planning in domains of human endeavor that require the
        compartmentalization of information. Planners can introduce one or
        more classification systems to a Plan.</para>

    <title>An information sharing planning method</title>
    <section>
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>Channels encourages and supports a methodical approach to
      information sharing planning.</para>

      <para>The main activities of this method are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The method here outlined does not address the politics and project
      logistics of information sharing planning.</para>

      <para>When building a new Information Sharing Plan, planners must first
      decide on the scope of the Plan. The scope is set by choosing:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the anticipated types of events planned for,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the specific phases (before, during or after) to be covered
          for each event,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the organizations and roles which involvement is
          expected.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Planners divide the Plan into segments. Each segment covers one
      phase of one event and a small list of risks to organizations. Two
      segments can cover the same event phase, but not the same goal for the
      same phase of the same event.</para>

      <para>A planner works on one segment at a time and can switch attention
      to another segment at any time. When working on a segment, tasks and
      information flows linking tasks are identified and defined so that they
      together address the risks covered by the segment.</para>

      <para>Events, phases, agents, roles, organizations, places, and
      communication media are collectively called entities. Entities are
      referenced by name in the definitions of a plan's scope, a segment's
      coverage, tasks, information flows, and other entities. An entity can be
      referenced by name prior to being defined. An entity should be defined
      soon after having first been referenced.</para>

      <para>The Plan is best grown by progressively closing gaps (completeness
      issues) such as those caused by:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>events or goals not addressed,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>unsatisfied task information needs,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>information produced by tasks that is not shared,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>tasks to which no known agents are assigned,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>information flows with no listed communication media.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Planners can also be presented with issues other than completeness
      issues, namely, validity and robustness issues. Planners prioritize the
      resolution of issues possibly on the basis of their severity. Some types
      of issues can be waived if deemed “false positives”. When tackling an
      issue, planners may choose to first survey their peers and participants
      involved in the Plan about alternate remediation strategies.</para>

      <para>The planning process is iterative and non-linear. At any point in
      time, planners can:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>change the scope of a Plan,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>add/modify/remove new Plan segments,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>add/modify/remove tasks and flows in a segment,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>resolve issues,</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>(re)define referenced entities.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>At any point during the development of a Plan, planners may decide
      to deploy the current version to participants. If a previous version had
      already been deployed, it is immediately retired and superseded by the
      new one. Keep in mind that a Plan is never complete and planning is
      never done.</para>

        <para>Work on a Plan is always done on its development version. There

        playbooks from the production version of a Plan.</para>

        <para>When all planners vote in favor of deployment, a new production

      <title>Information Sharing Planning and Business Process
      Management</title>

      <para>The most frequently asked question about Information Sharing
      Planning is How does it differ from Business Process Management?</para>

      <para>To answer this question, one must first consider that Information
      Sharing Planning (ISP) is part of something larger called Information
      Sharing Management.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Information Sharing Management</emphasis> (ISM) is a set
      of technologies and best practices that help communities of
      organizations share information more effectively in order to manage
      risks when preparing for, responding to, and recovering from actual
      events. Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces the information
      sharing procedures that organizations apply when doing ISM. ISP analyzes
      these procedures for continuous improvement.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Business Process Management</emphasis> (BPM) helps
      enterprises become more efficient, more effective and more agile in how
      they operate. Business Process Modeling captures and analyzes their
      business processes for continuous improvement.</para>

      <para>Because ISP relates most closely to Business Process Modeling, the
      question should be recast to How does Information Sharing Management
      differ from Business Process Management?</para>

      <para>Other questions are Can ISM and BPM be used together?, and How do
      the markets for BPM and ISM compare?</para>

      <section>
        <title>Differences</title>

        <para>BPM and ISM tackle different problems from different
        perspectives.</para>

        <para>BPM focuses 'inward' on a single (but possibly extended)
        enterprise. It looks at how the enterprise responds internally to
        events, and at how it renders services to its customers. The end is
        maximizing value creation while minimizing costs. The means is
        business process improvement.</para>

        <para>ISM focuses 'outward' on (often ad hoc) communities of
        organizations. It looks at how organizations depend on one another to
        get the information they need to execute tasks that achieve
        organizational goals. The end is minimizing the impacts of systemic
        risks and maximizing the capture of opportunities. The means is better
        information sharing procedures.</para>

        <para>While there is conceptual overlap (both ISM and BPM involve
        tasks, events and communications) and even though they both use
        somewhat similar-looking visualizations (directed graphs), ISM and BPM
        have very different world views. BPM looks at the operations of an
        enterprise, whereas ISM looks at the information flows within a
        community of organizations. They also differ in their goals. BPM
        optimizes enterprise value creation whereas ISM reduces the impacts of
        systemic risks.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Similarities</title>

        <para>ISM and BPM are structurally similar in a number of ways.</para>

        <para>Both BPM and ISM are concerned with optimization. BPM optimizes
        the design and execution of business processes, whereas ISM optimizes
        information sharing procedures and their application.</para>

        <para>BPM and ISM each has a modeling component (business process
        modeling, information sharing planning) and a deployment component
        (modeled business processed are deployed as work flows, information
        sharing plans are deployed as information sharing procedures).</para>

        <para>Both BPM and ISM integrate with existing systems and
        technologies. BPM integrates with EAI (Enterprise Application
        Integration), SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and EBA (Event-Based
        Architecture) technologies. ISM integrates primarily with
        Communication Technologies, Enterprise Directories and SOA.</para>

        <para>Finally, both BPM and ISM require the participation of analysts.
        BPM involves 'business process engineers' and ISM involves
        'information sharing planners'.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Integration</title>

        <para>Because BPM and ISM have such different world views, we should
        not expect either to eventually absorb the other.</para>

        <para>There are however significant points of interaction between BPM
        and ISM. To name a few, business processes can be driven by events
        that become known through information sharing, and the business
        processes executed when carrying out risk-mitigating tasks can be
        optimized.</para>

        <para>It is reasonable to assume that BPM and ISM products will, in
        some future, work together to their mutual benefit.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Markets</title>

        <para>“The BPM market is one of the fastest growing software markets,
        estimated to grow tenfold in five years, from approximately US$500
        million in 2006 to US$6 billion in 2011.” <footnote>
            <para>See
            <uri>http://www.oracle.com/technologies/bpm/docs/state-of-bpm-market-whitepaper.pdf</uri></para>
          </footnote></para>

        <para>While BPM is a maturing field, ISM is still in its infancy. It
        is too early to attempt an estimate of how fast the market for ISM
        could grow or how big it could ultimately become.</para>

        <para>However, ISM is applicable to all domains of joint human
        endeavor, from emergency response to business risk management. With
        the explosive growth in systemic risks, as underscored by the recent
        financial crisis, the value proposition of ISM in an increasingly
        inter-connected world is bound to become compelling.</para>

        <para>As BPM products become consolidated among a small number of
        large vendors, ISM may represent a unique opportunity for small firms
        to enter and define a new market space. Established BPM vendors might
        also want to offer BPMintegrated ISM products in order to
        differentiate themselves from their competitors.</para>
