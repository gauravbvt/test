      <para>This document introduces the key concepts of Information Sharing
      Planning, provides a reference guide to the Channels Web application,
      and shows how to apply the ISP Method with Channels to systematically
      build and analyze information sharing plans. A lexicon of ISP terms and

      <title>Why Plan the Sharing of Information?</title>

      <para>Most organizations now operate in complex "ecosystems" where they
      depend on each other for information critical to their missions. It is
      common wisdom that getting the right information at the right time is
      essential to achieving mission success. This is even more so in a
      connected world where opportunities can be fleeting and risks can spread
      not only quickly but far and wide.</para>

      <para>Yet most organizations do not plan how they should share
      information within and across organizational boundaries. It is something
      of a paradox that while they will plan their finances or model their
      business processes to achieve greater efficiency, they will rarely
      define how they need to communicate to better prevent, respond or
      recover from crises.</para>

      <para>Failure to plan how information should flow can cost lives, money,
      reputation. During a crisis, information will not spontaneously flow as
      needed and maintaining contact lists is clearly not enough.
      Organizations must prepare and create actionable information sharing
      procedures. Information sharing can and should be planned not only to be
      prepared but also to capture, retain and disseminate communication best
      practices.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Information Sharing Planning (ISP) models, analyzes and
      deploys knowledge of how organizations need to share information to
      mitigate systemic risks and seize opportunities from anticipated events.
      </emphasis></para>

      <para>ISP provides a framework and method for designing and improving
      the information sharing procedures required by networked organizations
      to achieve their missions.</para>

      <title>Why Use Channels to Plan Information Sharing?<!--JF:  Chapter 1 should remain ISP specific.  This whole section should be moved to Chapter 2.  See note on Section 3 below.--></title>

      <para>Planners use Channels, a Web application, to jointly build
      information sharing plans (IS plans). Planning information sharing is
      done ahead of anticipated events. Channels is not meant for managing the
      actual sharing of information during a crisis.</para>

      <para>When building IS plans using Channels, planners clarify and
      uncover:</para>

      <para>Building an IS plan in Channels can be divided into<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>modeling information sharing practices (IS practices)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>profiling the environment (organizations, people, and
            places) the IS practices apply to</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>When modeling IS practices, planners describe what
      <emphasis>kind</emphasis> of people and systems (or
      <firstterm>agents</firstterm>) are to be assigned to planned tasks. More
      importantly, planners describe what information would be acquired by the
      execution of a task and then shared with others who need it to carry out
      their own tasks. A model of IS would normally not identify task
      assignees by name, but rather specify them by their roles,
      qualifications, and/or jurisdictions and by the types of organizations
      they belong to.</para>

      <para>When entering the profiles of people, systems, and organizations
      into an IS plan, planners do so with the expectation that profiles will
      match the descriptions of task assignees. Once assigned to a task, an
      agent can become committed to sharing information acquired by executing
      the task as specified by the (modeled) IS practices.</para>

      </figure>

      <para>All modeling is done via input forms. At all times, even if only
      minimal data has been entered, an IS plan can be visualized, analyzed,
      diagnosed, and applied to people and systems profiled as members of
      organizations.</para>

      <para>By using Channels to build IS plans, planners produce:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>a reusable, transportable model of informations sharing (best)
          practices</para>

          of failure, and other issues</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>A model of information sharing practices is visualized primarily
      as information flow maps. Information flow maps depict (specifications
      of) tasks connected by information flows.</para>

      <para>Channels automatically detects issues in an IS plan (upwards of 90
      different types of issues). Issues are communicated to planners visually
      (tasks and flows drawn in red) and in other ways as well (issues panels
      throughout, all-issues table, issues summary report). The entire set of
      outstanding issues is recalculated with every change planners make to
      the plan. Planners can manually indicate issues that Channels cannot
      detect, usually because the specific issues require domain
      knowledge.</para>

      <para>An issue has a description, a list of suggested remediations, and
      a severity level (minor, major, severe, extreme). The severity of an
      issue is either a constant for the type of issue, or it is calculated
      from the potential cascade of task failures attributable to the issue,
      in which case the severity is set by the most severe risk not mitigated
      or the most valuable gain not realized because of the failure.</para>

      <para>Issue diagnostics is one of many kinds of analysis Channels
      performs on an IS plan. Another is failure impact analysis. Channels can
      show what would happen should a planned task not be performed or should
      some information not be shared as planned.</para>

      <para>Channels applies the modeled IS practices to actual people and

      in the plan and printed.</para>

      <para>By applying modeled IS practices to known people and systems in
      organizations, Channels can determine how organizations ought to be
      networked for an IS plan to be realized.</para>

      <para>While the effort required to model IS practices far exceeds that
      of simply drawing information flow maps using a drawing tool, the
      benefits of modeling IS practices using Channels are substantial and
      include the automated generation of personalized IS guidelines, issue
      detection, and analyses that illuminate the properties and consequences
      of applying these practices.</para>

        <para>An <firstterm linkend="information_sharing_plan">Information

        <firstterm>information sharing commitments</firstterm> required of
        people and systems (<firstterm linkend="agent">agents</firstterm>) in
        <firstterm linkend="role">roles</firstterm> of responsibility to
        fulfill the missions of their <firstterm
        linkend="organization">organizations</firstterm>, before, during,
        and/or after <firstterm linkend="event">events</firstterm> of
        significance.</para>

        <para>Agents achieve goals that fulfill their organizations' missions
        by executing, individually or as teams, <firstterm>tasks</firstterm>
        assigned to them. By executing their assigned tasks, agents directly
        manage <firstterm linkend="risk">risks</firstterm>, achieve <firstterm
        linkend="gain">gains</firstterm>, and/or produce information needed by
        other tasks. <firstterm linkend="information_sharing_flow">Information
        sharing flows</firstterm> connect tasks that produce information with
        tasks that need it. Information can be shared between people, people
        and systems, or between systems, over <firstterm
        linkend="transmission_medium">transmission media</firstterm> or
        face-to-face. Sharing can be subject to <firstterm
        linkend="policy">policies</firstterm>.</para>

        <para>When planners define a task, they either identify or profile the
        agents to be assigned to it. Profiling task assignees can be done more
        or less broadly by specifying them in terms of their organizations,
        <firstterm>roles</firstterm>, <firstterm>qualifications</firstterm>
        and/or <firstterm>jurisdictions</firstterm>. Agents can be bound by
        information sharing commitments whenever they are assigned to tasks
        that are connected by flows to other tasks. Agents commit to share
        <firstterm linkend="information">information</firstterm> they acquire
        when doing a task with some or all agents who execute flow-connected
        tasks. Recipient agents commit not to use the information for other
        purposes.</para>

        <para>It is important to understand that an information sharing plan
        is not an <emphasis>action</emphasis> plan. Unlike Business Process
        Modeling, the objective of Information Sharing Planning (ISP) is not
        to optimize, script, or automate activities. The overarching objective
        of building an IS plan is to ensure that information does flow as
        required in order to successfully manage risks and capture
        opportunities.</para>

        <para>Task sequencing is however not entirely absent from an IS plan.
        A task triggered by information requires the prior execution of
        another task producing it. Such sequencing constraints do not
        typically apply to all tasks in an IS plan, and thus an IS plan will
        most often not dictate a unique sequence for all tasks.</para>

        <para>This is a good thing. Attempting to define a precisely
        orchestrated action plan for organizations without a central authority
        is almost always an exercise in futility. So, while an IS plan
        certainly captures what needs to be done, the focus is squarely on how
        information needs to flow to ensure that mission-accomplishing tasks
        are successful. The details of exactly how these tasks are to be
        executed is outside the scope of ISP.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>IS plan = IS practices + environment</title>

        <para>An IS plan can be understood as <firstterm>information sharing
        practices</firstterm> applied to an
        <firstterm>environment</firstterm>. Information sharing practices are
        definitions of tasks and the information flows between them. An
        environment is composed of agents (people and systems) in roles of
        responsibility within organizations. These agents are assigned to
        flow-connected tasks and consequently have information sharing
        commitments.</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Flow-connected tasks in the IS practices model of an IS
          plan</title>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>In order to separate (decouple) IS practices and environment, it
        is recommended to model IS practices without mentioning actual
        organizations, people, or systems. It is best to specify tasks as
        being executed by "disembodied" roles from <emphasis>types</emphasis>
        of organizations (e.g. a "forensic autopsy" is to be carried by a
        "coroner" from a "county health office"). IS practices models that are
        not attached to a particular environment can be applied, possibly with
        some local adaptations, to various environments.</para>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>An IS plan's environment identifies the actual people or systems
        that play the organizational roles mentioned in the IS practices model
        (or IS model for short). For example, planners could build an IS model
        for responding to an epidemic outbreak at the state level, and then
        apply the same IS model to different states, each state being a
        different environment with its own organizations and role-assigned
        agents.</para>

        <para>Note that there is not yet explicit support in the current
        release of Channels for separately managing the IS model and
        environment of an IS plan, or for explicitly composing IS plans by
        applying one reusable IS model to different environments. A
        forthcoming release of Channels will provide such support. In the
        meanwhile, planners are strongly encouraged to follow the above best
        practice of keeping the IS model as decoupled as possible from the IS
        plan's environment.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Event phases, goals, and segments</title>

        <para>The scope of an IS plan is primarily set by identifying the
        events of significance the plan must address. (A plan's scope is also
        set by the list of organizations that are expected to participate in
        the plan.) An event of significance (or event, for short) is something
        that is true somewhere for some time and that challenges, in and of
        itself, the mission of one or more organizations by introducing risks
        or by creating opportunities for gains. Organizations assign their
        agents to tasks that mitigate these risks or make gains. An event can
        bring different risks or opportunities to different organizations. For
        example, an explosion at a refinery, clearly an event of significance,
        endangers the lives of workers, would likely cause financial losses to
        insurers, and might profit commodity traders.</para>

        <para>The events in an IS plan are not actual events that did or will
        occur at specific times and locations. They are implicitly
        <emphasis>types</emphasis> of events that might happen in some
        indeterminate future in some location that can be identified (e.g., in
        New York City) or specified (e.g., in a large urban area).</para>

        after <firstterm>phases</firstterm> of an event (<firstterm>event
        phases</firstterm>). Typically the purpose of tasks in a "before"
        phase of an event will be to cause or prevent the event. Tasks in a
        "during" phase of an event will normally be about responding to the
        event as it is unfolding in order to minimize its negative
        consequences or maximize positive outcomes. Tasks in an "after" phase
        will often deal with recovering from the aftermath of an event, or
        reaping its rewards.</para>

        <para>An IS plan will typically focus on at least one, and at most a
        few, events of significance, and cover one or more phases for each of
        these events. Events within the scope of a plan are a combination of
        events that happen outside the control of the participants of the plan
        (so-called <emphasis>incidents</emphasis>) and of events caused by
        planned tasks (and are thus under the control of participants).</para>

        <para>An IS plan should also address only a small, manageable number
        of organizational risks or opportunities stemming from events in
        scope. It is recommended, when starting on a new IS plan, not to
        involve too many organizations having too many goals in too many
        phases of too many events. It is better to start small and focused and
        then grow as needed.</para>

        <para>Information sharing plans typically deal with more than one
        event phase, and they can involve a sizable number of organizations.
        Because plans can become quite large, planners break them into
        smaller, more manageable units of planning called
        <firstterm>segments</firstterm>.</para>

        <para>An IS plan <glossterm>segment</glossterm> covers only one phase
        of one event, possibly in the context of some other past or currents
        events. For example, a segment might focus on responding to a "stock
        price rally" (event phase focus) during "a volatile market" and after
        a prior "hostile takeover attempt" (context events).</para>

        <para>A segment might address all or only some of the organizational
        goals associated with an event phase. In other words, more than one
        segment may be dedicated to a given event phase, with each segment
        addressing a different list of organizational goals. Two segments
        should not address the same goal for the same event phase.</para>

        <para>A segment lists one or more organization goals (a segment
        without goals is an issue detected by Channels). A
        <emphasis>goal</emphasis> is either a risk to an organization (or type
        of organization) to be mitigated, or a gain to be realized by an
        organization (or type of organization). Each risk is categorized from
        a list of types of risks derived from actuarial risk management
        taxonomies. Each gain is also categorized from a list that is the
        "mirror image" of the risk types. Risks are rated as minor, major,
        severe, or extreme. Gains are rated as low, medium, high, or highest.
        Planners can indicate if a risk is implicitly mitigated or a gain
        implicitly realized once the event phase covered by the segment is
        terminated.</para>

        <para>Every task and flow in an IS plan belongs to one and only one
        segment. A segment should contain all the flow-enabled tasks that
        directly achieve the segment's goals, plus flow-enabled tasks on which
        goal-achieving tasks depend to start, terminate, or succeed.</para>

        <para>Segments are normally not disjoint; flows usually connect one or
        more tasks in one segment to tasks in another. Furthermore a task in
        one segment might initiate the event phase addressed by the other
        segment either by causing an event or terminating it. Initiation of an
        event starts the "during" phase of that event and terminates its
        "before" phase. Termination of an event starts the "after" phase of
        that event.</para>

        <title>Flows and tasks</title>

        <para>Flows and the tasks they connect are the building blocks of the
        IS practices model in an IS plan. A task describes an action carried
        out at some location and for some purpose by one or more agents.
        Agents act to fulfill the responsibilities of the roles bestowed on
        them by organizations. The agents expected to carry out a task can be
        identified by any combination of name, role, jurisdiction, and
        organization. The executor of a task may be identified only partially
        (for example, by role and organization only) so that more than one
        person or system will match the profile and get assigned to the task.
        According to a task's definition, those assigned to the task are
        expected to carry it out either as a team or on their own. The timing
        aspects of a task execution can be given, namely, how long the task
        takes to complete and how soon it repeats, if at all. A task might
        cause or prevent an event.</para>

        <title>Entities</title>

        <para>An IS plan references by name various agents, places, roles,
        organizations, events, transmission media and phases of events. These
        are referred to in ISP as entities. An ISP entity is anything that can
        be named in an IS plan but is neither a task nor information. An ISP
        entity is always unambiguously referenced by name in a plan, its
        segments, tasks, and flows, or in the profiles of other entities.
        There can only be one agent named "John Doe", only one event named
        "lawsuit filed," etc.</para>

        <para>There are actual entities and there are types of entities.
        Actual entities (“Jane Smith”, “ACME Inc.”, “Morristown, Morris
        County, NJ, USA,” etc.) are categorized by types of entities (“Senior
        executive”, “Corporation”, “City” etc.). Entity types can refine other
        entity types (a “Senior executive” is a kind of “Executive”).</para>

        <para>Actual entities can be categorized by entity types of the same
        kind (agents are categorized by agent types etc.) but entity types
        themselves can be categorized by other entity types, thus forming
        implicit typologies.</para>

        <para>An <glossterm>agent</glossterm> is either a person or an
        information system (system for short). An agent is capable of sending
        or receiving notifications and sending and answering queries. An agent
        has contact information and availability (24/7 by default). An agent's
        clearance is a list of secrecy classifications (e.g., NATO Top Secret
        and US Gov. Secret).</para>

        <para>An agent type can be thought of as a qualification that can be
        shared by different agents (e.g., "Adult" or "Registered driver"). An
        agent type is not to be confused with a role. A role implies
        responsibilities, whereas an agent type denotes qualifications or
        status.</para>

        <para>An agent can be flagged as a system (non-human).</para>

        <para>When a group of agents are indistinguishable from a planning
        perspective (for example, call center operators), they can be profiled
        as a single <glossterm>archetype</glossterm> agent (for example, "a
        call center operator").</para>

        <para>When the identity of an agent is to be resolved by associating
        the agent with one or more users of Channels, the agent is marked as a
        <firstterm>placeholder</firstterm> (more on this later). Agents are
        references in the definitions of tasks and organizations (their
        members and their supervisors).</para>

        <para>An <glossterm>organization</glossterm> is a group of agents
        organized to accomplish a mission. An organization assigns roles of
        responsibility to the persons and systems that act on its behalf. An
        organization has contact information and may contain other
        organizations. An organization may have information sharing agreements
        with other organizations to formalize the sharing commitments its
        members have with members of other organizations. Organizations are
        referenced in the definitions of a plan itself (organizations that are
        expected to participate), in segments (organizational risks), tasks,
        and as parents of other organizations.</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>role</glossterm> is a set of powers and
        responsibilities bestowed by an organization to an agent acting on
        behalf of the organization. A role assignment may be restricted to a
        jurisdiction (a place). A role is always an entity type. Roles are
        referenced in tasks and in organizations (roles played by their
        members).</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>place</glossterm> is either a geographical area
        (some city, county, state, country, natural preserve, etc.) or a known
        location (some train station, building, etc.). A place can be
        contained in another (for example, a building can be in a campus).
        Places are referenced in a plan's definition (the plan's default
        locale), in events (an event and an event type can both be located to
        a place), in tasks (location of execution and jurisdiction of
        assignees), and in organizations (address and jurisdictions of
        members).</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>phase</glossterm> names a time period relative to
        events. A phase is either set to before, during, or after events.
        Typical phases are “Preparing,” “Responding,” and “Recovering”. A
        phase is always an entity type. Phases are referenced in a plan's
        definition (phases in scope), and in segments (event phase in focus
        and event phases in context).</para>

        <para>A <glossterm>transmission medium</glossterm> is a means by which
        agents transmit information to one another. Transmission media may or
        may not be technology-based. A medium is either unicast (transmits to
        a single, known agent), multicast (transmits to multiple, known
        agents), or broadcast (little to no control over who receives the
        transmission).</para>
        <para>A transmission medium can delegate transmissions to other media.
        For example, VoIP can interface with Telephones. The security of a
        medium is expressed in terms of secrecy classifications. A
        transmission medium is always an entity type. Transmission media are
        referenced in the definitions of communication channels. Communication
        channels are used to define information flows, needs and capabilities,
        and the contact information of agents and organizations.</para>

        <para>Planners can define one or more classification systems in an IS
        plan and make use of them classify elements of
        information, define transmission
        media security, and to set the security clearances of (actual) agents.</para>

        <para>A secrecy classification has a name (e.g. “NATO”) and an ordered
        list of secrecy levels (“Restricted,” “Confidential,” “Secret,” “Focal
        Top Secret,”and “Cosmic Top Secret”).</para>

        <title>The meaning of information in ISP</title>

        <para>Tasks and flows are defined in terms of information needed,
        uncovered and shared. Information is named and is broken into atomic
        elements. Each <firstterm>element of information</firstterm> is named,
        can be given security classifications and can be annotated with a
        description and handling instructions.</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Elements of information</title>

          <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
              <imagedata align="center"
                         fileref="user_guide_images/eoi_transformation.png"
                         scale="75"></imagedata>
            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>Elements of information sent from a task can be described as the
        result of transforming elements received in the execution of the task.
        An element of information (EOI) sent can be the same as an EOI
        received, can be an EOI received but renamed, or can be an aggregation
        of EOIs received (for example a count, a synthesis,etc.).</para>

        <para>An element of information is considered atomic for the purposes
        of a plan; it is the indivisible unit of transmission and
        transformation. Once aggregated, an EOI can not be "split
        apart".</para>

        <para>The notion of the plurality of an element is left undefined. For
        example, if "suspicious activity report" information contains the
        element "suspect profile," then it is possible that there will be more
        than one suspect profile in a report.</para>

        <para>When analyzing flows, Channels is not concerned with what the
        information actually means. Channels has no domain knowledge to infer
        from. Rather, it cares about whether or not two flows concern the same
        information, and whether an element of information is the same as, or
        is the transformation of, another element of information.</para>

        <para>If the information in two flows have the same name, it does not
        necessarily mean that they represent, conceptually, the same
        information. Two tasks performed respectively by a EOC commander and a
        corporate CEO might both need a "situation assessment," but they would
        likely not need the same kind of situation assessment with the same
        elements of information (even if the elements themselves have
        identical names).</para>

        <para>In Channels, identically named flows, needs, and capabilities
        (uppercase vs. lowercase and extra spaces are ignored) are explicitly
        meant to represent the same kind of information (they are synonymous)
        <emphasis>if and only if</emphasis> they connect to the same tasks
        (one flow may be a "send" and the other one a "receive"). Similarly,
        identically named elements of information are meant to represent the
        same atom of information <emphasis>if only if</emphasis> the information they compose
        have the same meaning.</para>

        <para>Agents executing a task receive and send information. The
        information they receive and send may have different names yet have
        common elements of information. For example, the "suspect profile"
        element of a sent "suspicious activity report" may be the same as the
        "suspect description" element of a received "security tip", and it may
        be the same as the "suspect profile" of received "BOLO"
        information.</para>

        <para>Alternately, an element sent may aggregate elements received.
        Aggregation combines many elements into a single element, with loss of
        data. For example, a "suspects count" element aggregates "suspect
        profile" elements into a single number, losing the details of the
        individual profiles. Counting is only one of many possible kinds of
        aggregation. A "threat level," for example, might aggregate a great
        deal of different elements into a high vs. low rating.</para>

        <para>In order to track the dissemination of information, it necessary
        to indicate when sent elements are the result of renaming or
        aggregating received elements. Channels need only differentiate
        between those two kinds of element transformation in order to track
        the dissemination of information. The description field of an element
        of information can be used to provide more details about the specific
        nature of an aggregation.</para>

        <para>Issue detection takes element renaming and aggregation into
        account. For example, while it may be acceptable to declassify
        aggregated elements, it is not acceptable to declassify a renamed,
        classified element.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Task assignments and information sharing commitments</title>

        <para>A task in an IS plan is a specification of some action to be
        done or some decision to be made either all the time, upon witnessing
        the start or end of an event, or upon receiving a notification or a
        request for information. In defining a task, planners normally do not
        identify by name the actual agents to be assigned to the tasks, but
        rather describe their profile in terms of their qualifications (as
        agent types), roles, jurisdictions (as named places or types of
        places), and/or organizations (by name or by type).</para>

        <para>What is meant by "directly or indirectly"? Let's say that FBI
        (an actual organization) is categorized as both a "Law Enforcement
        Agency" and "Federal Agency", and "Federal Agency" is categorized as a
        "Government Agency", then the FBI would directly match "Law
        Enforcement Agency" and indirectly match "Government Agency".</para>

        <para>Any agent assigned to a task that sends information to another
        task (i.e. is connected by a flow targeting the other task) commits to
        share it with some or all agents assigned to the task receiving the
        information. A task assigned to three agents with a flow targeting
        another task assigned to two agents might imply six different
        information sharing commitments, one from each assignee of the
        information-producing task to each assignee of the
        information-consuming task.</para>

        <para>If the flow is annotated as "to every", then the commitment is
        to share it with all assignees of the target task, otherwise the flow
        is "to any" and the commitment is to share with at least one of the
        assignees of the target task.</para>

        <para>Not all assignees of the target task are necessarily eligible to
        be beneficiaries of information sharing commitments (commitments for
        short). Commitments can be subject to restrictions or prohibitions.
        Commitments can be restricted to agents in the same or different
        organization or in organizations with the same parent organizations.
        They can be restricted to agents in the same location or different
        location, to agents who are supervisors. Commitments can be restricted
        to one self, which may sound odd until one realizes that an agent
        might uncover information doing a task, keep it to oneself and start
        another task on the basis of this information (an agent has in essence
        notified itself to trigger another task). Commitments can also be
        restricted to "someone else" or to agents in both the same
        organization and location.</para>

        rules" in IS plans. (More on that later.)</para>

        <para>An agent's information sharing procedures (IS procedures) is the
        list of all task assignments for the agent plus all associated
        information sharing commitments. An agent's information sharing
        guidelines are produced from the IS procedures computed by Channels
        for that agent.</para>

        <para>Many analytics in Channels (dissemination, impact failure,
        network, various type of issues) depend on the computing of IS
        procedures for all agents in an IS plan. Because matching of profiles
        involves entity types, the proper design of typologies (for agents,
        roles, places, organizations etc.) is key to successfully building IS
        plans.</para>

        <title>Expressing exceptions by overriding tasks and flows</title>

        <para>It is at times necessary to express "exceptions to the rule"
        when modeling IS practices. For example, IS practices might dictate
        that all employees alert their supervisors if they become aware of
        suspicious activities, whereas managers, who are also employees,
        should not alert their supervisors but rather directly contact the
        head of security.</para>

        <para>Such exceptions in IS practices can be captured by defining
        overriding tasks and by defining prohibited flows from the overriding
        tasks that are otherwise equivalent to flows from the overriden
        tasks.</para>

        <title>Information sharing agreements</title>

        <para>An information sharing agreement is a formal recognition that an
        organization commits to share certain information with another
        organization.</para>

        <para>Channels finds the information sharing commitments of agents
        between each pair of organizations and, for each "networking" pair,
        aggregates the commitments into distinct "information sharing
        relationships". Each information sharing relationship is a summary of
        sharing commitments for particular information (the agents in the
        commitments and their roles are abstracted out). For example, an
        information sharing relationship would summarize the fact that members
        of Bank A commit to share fraud information with members of Bank B.
        For each such relationship, planners can indicate whether an
        information sharing commitment has been formalized, and attach or link
        to the document formalizing the agreement.</para>

        if a sharing agreement is confirmed but not documented, an issue is
        also raised. Note that in applying these constraints, Channels does
        not distinguish when both organizations belong to a common parent
        organization and when they do not.</para>

        <title>Descriptions, instructions and attachments</title>

        <para>Not everything in the definition of an IS plan can be captured
        neatly as "structured data". Some important data is best conveyed with
        free form text or via attached documents.</para>

        <para>Most forms used to define elements of an IS plan contain a text
        field called "description" where planners can optionally enter
        explanatory or documentary text. Instead of a description field, tasks
        and flows have instruction fields. Descriptions and instructions are
        not examined by Channels (Channels is indifferent to their content)
        but they do appear in IS guidelines generated by Channels.</para>

        <para>Sometimes an element of a plan or the plan itself can be
        documented by a PDF or a Web page or illustrated by a photo or a
        video. Channels allows planners to attach documents to a plan element
        by uploading them or linking to them in the context of that
        element.</para>

        <para>An attachment is optionally given a name (its URL is the default
        name). It is also given a type. Different kinds of plan elements allow
        different kinds of attachment types. Certain types of attachments have

        <title>Tagging</title>

        <para>Tags provide a useful mechanism for the ad hoc cataloguing of
        elements of an IS plan that otherwise may have nothing else in common.
        Most elements of a plan can be tagged. An element can have multiple,
        comma-separated tags.</para>

        <para>The set of all tags in an IS plan is called the tag domain. Tags
        can be grouped by named sub-domains. When a tag belongs to a
        sub-domain, the tag is written as the name of the sub-domain followed
        by a colon followed by the name of the tag. For example,
        "esf:transportation" is the tag "transportation" in the tag sub-domain
        "esf". A planner can easily look up all elements tagged with tags
        belonging to a given sub-domain. Tag sub-domains can be predefined and
        attached to an IS plan (an attachment of type "Tag") prior to the tags
        being used. Note that tags need not be predefined to be used in
        tagging plan elements.<figure>

        <para>A special kind of tag sub-domain is called an "information
        standard". Each information standard tag is associated with a list of
        predefined elements of information, each with a name, and optional
        description and handling instructions. When a flow is tagged with an
        information standard tag, its elements of information can be
        auto-populated with those associated with the tag. An information
        standard tag sub-domain is added to an IS plan by attaching a file
        defining them (an attachment of type "Info standards").</para>

      <title>How is ISP different from BPM?<!--JF:  Especially if you are planning on keeping Sections 2 and 3 in this chapter, rather than in Chapter 2, this section needs to move up to become section 2 in this chapter.  The move is probably a good idea, even if you move sections 2 and 3 to Chapter 2.--></title>

      <para>The most frequently asked question about Information Sharing
      Planning is "How is different from Business Process Management"?</para>

      <para>To answer this question, one must first consider that Information
      Sharing Planning (ISP) is part of something larger called Information
      Sharing Management.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Information Sharing Management</emphasis> (ISM) is a set
      of technologies and best practices that help communities of
      organizations share information more effectively in order to achieve
      their missions when preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
      actual events. Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces the
      information sharing procedures that organizations apply when actually
      sharing information. ISP analyzes these procedures for continuous
      improvement.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Business Process Management</emphasis> (BPM) helps
      enterprises become more efficient, more effective, and more agile in how
      they each operate. Business Process Modeling captures and analyzes
      business processes for continuous improvement.</para>

      <para>Because ISP relates most closely to Business Process Modeling, the
      question should be recast to "How do Information Sharing Management and
      Business Process Management differ"?</para>

      <para>Other questions are "Can ISM and BPM be used together"? and "How
      do the markets for BPM and ISM compare"?</para>

      <section>
        <title>Differences</title>

        <para>BPM and ISM tackle different problems from different
        perspectives.</para>

        <para>BPM focuses "inward" on a single (but possibly extended)
        enterprise. It looks at how the enterprise responds internally to
        events, and at how it renders services to its customers. The end is
        maximizing value creation while minimizing costs. The means is
        business process improvement.</para>

        <para>ISM focuses "outward" on (often ad hoc) communities of
        organizations. It looks at how organizations depend on one another to
        get the information they need to execute tasks that achieve
        organizational goals. The end is minimizing the impacts of systemic
        risks and maximizing the capture of opportunities. The means is better
        information sharing.</para>

        <para>While there is conceptual overlap (both ISM and BPM involve
        tasks, events, and communications) and even though they both use
        somewhat similar-looking visualizations (directed graphs), ISM and BPM
        have very different world views. BPM looks at the operations of an
        enterprise, whereas ISM looks at the information flows between a
        community of organizations. They also differ in their goals: BPM
        optimizes enterprise value creation whereas ISM reduces the impacts of
        systemic risks.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Similarities</title>

        <para>ISM and BPM are structurally similar in a number of ways.</para>

        <para>Both BPM and ISM are concerned with optimization. BPM optimizes
        the design and execution of business processes, whereas ISM optimizes
        information sharing procedures and their application.</para>

        <para>BPM and ISM each has a modeling component (business process
        modeling, information sharing planning) and a deployment component
        (modeled business processes are deployed as work flows, information
        sharing plans are deployed as information sharing procedures).</para>

        <para>Both BPM and ISM integrate with existing systems and
        technologies. BPM integrates with EAI (Enterprise Application
        Integration), SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and EBA (Event-Based
        Architecture) technologies. ISM integrates primarily with
        Communication Technologies, Enterprise Directories, and SOA.</para>

        <para>Finally, both BPM and ISM require the participation of analysts.
        BPM involves business process engineers and ISM involves information
        sharing planners.</para>

    <title>Using Channels</title>

    <para>As stated in Chapter 1, Channels is a collaborative Web application
    information sharing planners use to build, analyze, and deploy information
    sharing plans (IS plans).</para>

    <para>A Channels server can host multiple IS plans. Users can be given
    access to more than one plan hosted on a Channels server.</para>

    <para>IS plans are versioned. Each plan has one development version being
    developed, possibly one production version that can no longer be changed,
    and zero or more retired versions (prior production versions).</para>

    <section>
      <title>User Roles</title>

      <para>Channels recognizes three user roles: administrator, planner, and
      participant.</para>

      <para>A Channels server has at least one administrator. An administrator
      has unlimited rights and privileges over the Channels server and the
      plans hosted on it. A user is given planner privileges by an
      administrator for some or all plans on a Channels server. Planners
      jointly develop, review, and deploy IS plans for which they have been
      given planner status by an administrator. Users can be given participant
      access to some or all plans by an administrator. Participants view their
      IS procedures and respond to surveys from planners about issue
      resolution. A user can be a planner for some plans, a participant for
      others, and have no access whatever to plans for which he/she is neither
      planner nor participant.</para>

      <para>An administrator implicitly also has planner privileges over all
      plans hosted on the Channels server. A planner for a given plan
      implicitly also has participant privileges.</para>

      <para>An administrator of a Channels server can:</para>

        <para>Access to an external service requires account identification,
        either in the form of user id and password or in the form of an API
        key. When Channels is used as a service, external service
        configurations are already taken care of. However when installing a
        Channels server, an Administrator must acquire access to these
        external services and configure Channels to use the correct account
        information.</para>

        <para>Planners need to log into the
        SurveyGizmo<superscript></superscript> survey service to browse
        collected data and get reports. Planners also need to log into Google
        Calendar<superscript></superscript> to add, edit, or remove calendar
        events communicated in Channels.</para>

      <title>Information Sharing Model Page</title>

      <para>The information sharing model page is also known as the Plan
      Editor. It opens on the version (development or production) of a plan
      selected in the Home page. A user can only select plans for which he/she
      has planner privileges (unless the plan version is marked as a
      template).</para>

      <para>Only the development version of a plan can be modified. A
      production version is “read-only.” In a read-only version, all form
      fields are disabled and no survey can be launched about issue
      resolution.</para>

      <para>When the Plan Editor opens up on (a version of) a plan, Channels
      pre-selects a segment and a task within it. A segment and a task are
      always selected. The task with its “receive” and “send” information
      flows are shown “collapsed” and summarized.</para>

      <para>If the plan is brand new, an empty task in the otherwise empty and
      untitled segment is selected. The last task in a segment cannot be
      removed. The last segment in a plan cannot be removed.</para>

      <para>A planner can at any time switch segments, if more than one is
      defined. The tasks and information flows of the selected segment are
      visualized as a flow map (a directed graph). The selected task is
      highlighted (by a gray outlined rectangle) in the flow map.</para>

      <para>The Plan Editor window has four principal components:<itemizedlist>

        <para>The left and right arrow buttons are Channels' "back and

        <para>Tasks are the nodes (icons over text) in the graph. Information
        needs, capabilities, and sharing flows are represented by the arrows.
        Tasks and flows are drawn in red if they have known issues. Green and
        red traffic lights represent the start and end of the event phase
        covered by the segment. Tasks that are triggered by the start of the
        segment are connected to the green traffic light icon. Tasks that
        terminate the event phase are linked to the red traffic light.</para>

        <para>Information flows (information shared), information needs
        (information needed for carrying out, triggering, or terminating a
        task), and information capabilities (shareable information produced by
        carrying out a task) are shown as arrows. Single-headed arrows
        represent notifications. Double-headed arrows are request-replies,
        with the empty arrowhead pointing to the task that consumes the
        information request, and the solid arrowhead pointing to the task that
        consumes the answer (the requested information flows to it).</para>

        <para>Small squares stand for to-be-determined tasks. An arrow from a
        task to a dot represents an information capability of the task
        (information produced by the task that can be shared for use in other,
        to-be-determined tasks). An arrow from a small square to a task
        represents an information need of the task (the task needs information
        possibly produced by other, to-be-determined tasks).</para>

        <para>When risks and goals are shown in a flow map, they appear
        respectively as colored flags and stars connected to tasks (if they
        achieve a goal) and segment end icons (if goals are achieved by ending
        the segment's event phase).</para>

        <para>Tasks within a blue-gray rectangle denote tasks from other
        segments that are connected by sharing flows to tasks in the segment
        being viewed.</para>

        <title>Acquiring and releasing edit locks</title>

        <para>More than one planner can concurrently work on a plan.
        "Collisions" between two planners attempting to modify the same plan
        element are prevented by allowing only one planner at a time to modify
        any given task, flow, entity, segment definition, or plan
        definition.</para>

        <para>When a planner opens an edit form on a plan element, Channels
        attempts to grab an edit lock on behalf of the planner for that plan
        element. If another planner already owns the lock, the form is shown
        to the first planner with the editable fields disabled.</para>

        <para>A lock on a plan element owned by a planner is released when the
        planner collapses or closes its edit form, or logs out. An inactive
        planner eventually loses all acquired locks.</para>

        <para>The name of the owner of a lock appears to other planners
        usually in the place of the "actions" menu for the locked plan
        element. A message can be sent to the owner of a lock by clicking on
        his/her name.</para>

        <title>Semantic proximity matching</title>

        <para>Naming matters a lot in Channels. Entities are referenced by
        their unique names and are created when first named. Using different
        names for what is essentially the same role, type of organization,
        etc. would become a source of confusion and would undermine the
        usefulness of an IS plan. Whether the names of tasks, flows,
        information needs, capabilities, and information elements are
        different or the same determines whether needs are satisfied or
        satisfiable.</para>

        <para>Channels uses semantic proximity matching to promote convergence
        between planners toward a consistent, shared vocabulary for a
        plan.</para>

        <para>Semantic proximity matching works by looking for already used,
        similar names that could mean something close to the name currently
        being entered by a planner in a form. A drop down menu shows to the
        planner the alternate, semantically proximal names found. The planner
        may then elect to use a name already used instead of a new one with
        similar meaning.</para>

        Internet or over an intranet in which Channels operates.</para>

        <para>Documents can be attached, copied, or detached. Attachments are
        assigned a type. Certain types of attachment, for example, the picture
        type and the tags type impact the behavior of Channels (icons are
        generated and used, tags are added to the tag domain, etc.)
        Attachments can be named. The default name of an attachment is its
        URL.</para>

        <title>Tasks, receives and sends panels</title>

        <para>The task, receives and sends panels at the bottom of the plan
        editor show summaries of the selected task (there is always a task
        that is selected) together with a list of summaries of its "receives"
        (the task's information needs and the information flows to it) and a
        list of its "sends" (the task's information capabilities and the
        information flows from it). Each summary can be expanded into a form
        for editing (if the development version of the plan was the one
        selected on the Home page).</para>

        <para>Each of the summaries is prefixed with a colored bullet. The
        color of the bullet indicates how important a task or a flow is. The
        color indicates the calculated impact of the task or the flow failing
        completely. Blue indicates a minor impact, yellow is major, orange is
        severe, and red is extreme. Gray bullets are used when failure impact
        does not apply (information needs and capabilities).</para>

        <para>Clicking on the summary of a task or flow expands it by opening
        its edit form. Channels automatically adapts the width of task and
        flow forms to provide ease of editing. Clicking on the summary closes
        the form.</para>

        <para>Note that, with very few exceptions, any and all fields in any
        form in Channels can be left blank. Of course, leaving <emphasis>all</emphasis> fields in a form blank is of little value.</para>

          <title>Editing a task</title>

          <para>A task is defined by naming it, categorizing it, tagging it,
          and flagging it, or not, as operational and/or prohibited.
          (Remember, everything is optional.) It is further defined by stating
          where it is to be executed, by whom, in what role within what
          jurisdiction, and on behalf of what organization. Any of the
          location, agent, jurisdiction, role, and organization entities that
          specify a task can be left unnamed so as to imply that more than one
          agent can be assigned to the task. The names of entities can be
          indicated to refer to actual entities (Morristown, NJ, John Doe,
          ACME, etc.) or to types of entities (a city, a certified technician,
          a corporation, etc.).</para>

          <para>The execution of a task can be set to be “as a team” to
          indicate that all assigned agents are to work together when carrying
          out the task. By default, assignees are each to execute the task
          independently.</para>

          <para>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to
          complete, whether it repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts
          automatically with the segment (implying that the assigned agents
          would become aware on their own of the onset of the segment's event
          phase).</para>

          <para>The purpose of a task can be stated as causing an event,
          terminating the event phase addressed by the segment, mitigating one
          or more risks, or achieving gains within the segment's scope.</para>

          <para>Reference and policy documents can be attached to the task
          either by URL or by uploading them. Finally, the task can be given a
          brief, informal set of instructions.</para>

          <title>Editing a "send" or "receive"</title>

          <para>The first step in defining either an information need, an
          information capability, or an information flow is to name the
          information, identify its intent (command, alarm, announcement,
          report, or feedback), and list the elements of information.</para>

          <para>The mode of communication is given as either notification or
          by-request (push or pull).</para>

          <para>Planners can specify if the information would be shared only
          in case to task failure ("sends" only).</para>

          <para>If an information flow (information that is shared) is a
          notification, then it can be made a broadcast (information will be
          shared with all agents assigned to the target task) or a unicast
          (information will be shared with at least one agent assigned to the
          target task).</para>

          <para>Keep in mind that an information flow that is a “send” to its
          source task is a ”receive” to its target task. One is looking at a
          single flow from either of its two ends.</para>

          <para>An information flow can be created by first adding an
          information need to a task (if necessary), then adding an
          information capability of the same name in another (also if
          necessary), and then connecting the need to the capability or
          vice-versa by setting the “from” or “to” field to the other task.
          Another way to create an information flow is to start from an
          information need or capability of a task and then name the task at
          the other end of the flow. If a task of that name does not exist, a
          new one is created and connected.</para>

          <para>When specifying or determining the source or target of a flow,
          a planner can restrict the sources and targets to be within the same
          umbrella organization, within the same specific organization, or
          within the same location. Adding a restriction on a sharing flow may
          filter out sharing commitments that would otherwise be implied by
          the flow (e.g., by dropping any sharing commitment that crosses
          organizational boundaries).</para>

          <para>A communication delay is set either to zero (communication is
          to happen without delay) or to some finite time interval. For an
          information need, the delay represents the timeliness requirement
          for being notified (maximum delay from time of availability), or for
          getting a response to a request (maximum time elapsed from the
          request). For an information capability, the delay represents how
          quickly the information could be produced and communicated. For an
          information flow, the delay represents a “quality of service”
          commitment.</para>

          <para>The communication channels over which the information is to
          flow can be set for both an information need and for a notification
          information flow, but only when viewed from the notified task. The
          same is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the
          task that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels
          are listed in order of preference.</para>

          <para>When editing a “send” or “receive,” a planner can set whether
          sharing would normally trigger or terminate a task. A notification
          could trigger or terminate the receiving task. It could also
          terminate the sending task, if sending the notification concludes
          the task that produced the information. A request could trigger the
          task that produces a reply.</para>

          <para>Planners can attach documents to a “send” or “receive.” A
          document can be a reference, a mandating policy, a prohibiting
          policy, an unspecified policy (contains language that may impose
          both obligations and restrictions), or it can be an image provided
          as an illustration (for example, a screenshot). Note that attaching
          a prohibiting policy to an information flow does not prohibit the
          generation of information sharing commitments.</para>

          <para>Instructions can be given as text in the definition of "sends"
          and viewed in the definitions of received information flows.</para>

          <para>Information needed, shareable, or to-be shared can be
          decomposed into named elements. Each element of information sent or shareable can be
          described and assigned individual secrecy classifications as well as
          handling instructions. Planners can indicate whether and how a
          "sent" element of information is related to a received element of
          information (is the same one but renamed, is it an aggregation of
          many received elements?).</para>

          <para>An element sent is implicitly the same as one received if both
          are identically named and both comprise identically named incoming
          and outgoing information. If an element sent is in effect the same
          as one received but they have different names or comprise
          information with a different name, then planners need to indicate
          that the element sent renames the element received. If an element
          sent is a compilation/summation of multiple elements received,
          planners can identify the received elements that are aggregated into
          a sent element. Doing so enables Channels to track the planned
          dissemination of information.</para>

          <para>To reduce the drudgery of defining elements of information,
          the list can be auto-populated by clicking on the magic wand icon.
          Clicking on the classifications "link" icon forces all elements to
          have the same classification. Clicking again removes the
          constraint.</para>

        visualize and explore the assignments and commitments implicit in the
        flow maps. Remember that task assignments and information sharing
        commitments are implicit in a plan and are computed by Channels by
        matching known agents with task assignee specifications, and by
        applying the sharing restrictions set on flows that connect tasks to
        agents. In other words, assignments and commitments (IS procedures)
        are the result of applying an environment (known agents employed by
        known organizations) to an informations sharing model (specifications
        of tasks and flows).</para>

          <para>Inter-organizational sharing commitments are commitments
          between agents acting on behalf of different organizations. A
          sharing agreement may or may not exist for a sharing commitment that
          crosses organizational boundaries. It is an issue if an
          inter-organizational sharing commitment is unconfirmed when it is
          required by the committing organization. When viewing an
          organization, a planner can see the sharing commitments the
          organization makes with other organizations and confirm whether each
          commitment is covered or not by an agreement. A planner can attach
          documents of type MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) to confirmed
          sharing agreements. A sharing agreement not documented by a
          Memorandum of Understanding is an issue.</para>

          <title>Transmission medium profile panel</title>

          <para>When editing a transmission medium, a planner can set the
          transmission mode to either unicast (one -to-one), multicast
          (one-to-many), or broadcast (one-to-any), unless the mode of this
          medium is already implied by that of another medium categorizing
          it.</para>

          <para>The address pattern is a “regular expression” that constrains
          the form an “address” can take for this medium (see
          <uri>http://www.regular- expressions.info/</uri> for a tutorial on
          regular expressions). An empty pattern imposes no constraint on the
          value of an address/endpoint.</para>

          <para>A planner can identify what media this a transmission medium
          can interface with (delegates to) as it carries out transmissions
          from sender to receiver. For example, a notification system would
          interface with phone, email, pager, etc.</para>

          <para>Finally, a planner can describe the security of the
          transmission medium in terms of secrecy classifications. Qualifying
          a medium as “US Gov/Top Secret” means that Top Secret information
          can be transmitted securely over this medium.</para>

          <para>Keep in mind that all transmission media are types; there is
          no such thing in ISP as an "actual" transmission medium.</para>

          <para>An event in ISP is always an entity type (all events in ISP
          are anticipated, none are actual). A planner can set the location
          (actual or type) where actual events of this type would occur. A
          planner can also indicate whether or not this type of event can
          terminate on its own, that is, without the intervention of
          agents.</para>

          In addition to setting generic entity attributes (name, description,

        <title>Task assignments and sharing commitments panels</title>

        <para>Recall that a task can identity one assignee explicitly as an
        actual agent, but that tasks assignees are usually specified in terms
        of types of agents, roles, jurisdictions (actual or types of places),
        and organizations (types or actual). A task thus defined could be
        assigned to more than one agent. Channels looks up all agents known to
        a plan to determine which ones are to be assigned to the task.</para>

        <para>A planner can look up the list of known agents that are

        <title>Task overrides panel</title>

        <para>A task can be defined in such a way as to be a more specific
        case of another task, in effect overriding it. An overridden task can
        not be assigned any of the agents assigned to the overriding task.

      <section>
        <title>Failure impact analysis panel</title>

        <para>Planners can visualize what might happen should an agent fail
        completely at an assigned task or should an agent break a commitment
        to share information. The consequences could be a number of downstream
        tasks failing, leading to gains unachieved or risks
        unmitigated.</para>

        <para>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always
        complete; a failed task does not produce any information that may be
        required by others, and a failed information flow does not transfer
        any information whatsoever.</para>

        <para>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly
        or indirectly depend critically on, or are triggered by, information
        that fails to be produced or to be shared.</para>

        <para>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not
        critical to a task or does not trigger it, then its failure does not
        propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if the target of a flow can get
        the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the failure
        of the flow may not matter. Finally, if information produced by an
        agent is necessarily consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure
        to share is meaningless.</para>

        <para>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful
        tasks. A useful task is one that achieves goals or one that produces
        information that triggers, terminates or is critical to another task that is itself useful. 
        (Useless tasks are flagged as issues.)</para>
        
        <para>Note that a
        task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end
        and if the risk is said to terminate with the segment.</para>

        <para>A planner does “what-if” failure analysis by selecting a task or
        an information flow (“send” or “receive”) and then looking at the
        consequences should it fail. The planner can take a pessimistic
        outlook and assume that all redundant information flows would also
        fail, no matter what.</para>

        <para>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized
        as a directed graph of information flows, tasks, gains, and risks.
        Risks that would otherwise be mitigated or terminated by failed tasks
        are shown as color-coded flags. Red is for extreme risks, orange is
        for severe risks, yellow for major risks, and blue for minor risks.
        Risks that would normally be mitigated by successful tasks are shown
        connected to these tasks. Risks that would be terminated, should a
        segment end, are shown connected to red stop lights. Each stop light
        is itself connected to a failed task that would normally end the
        segment.</para>

        <para>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by
        importance, with red for very high, orange for high, yellow for
        medium, and blue for low.</para>

        <para>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed,
        goal-achieving tasks (the failures that matter) is compiled and
        presented. The table is paginated and the columns (failing task,
        segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization
        impacted) can be sorted.</para>

        <title>Information dissemination analysis panel</title>

        <para>If planners systematically indicate how elements of information
        flowing out of a task relate to elements of information flowing into a
        task, Channels becomes able to track the planned dissemination of
        individual elements of information. Dissemination tracking can be done
        forward (where does an element of information go?) and backward (where
        does an element of information come from?).</para>

        <para>A dissemination panel can be opened from a task, offering a
        choice of all elements received or sent by the task, or it can be
        opened from a flow, restricting the choice to the elements shared via
        the flow.</para>

        <para>Dissemination tracking from a task gives the option of looking
        at the sources as well as at the targets of individual elements of
        information. A dissemination panel opened on a "receive" flow only
        tracks sources, and a dissemination panel opened on a "send" flow only
        tracks targets.</para>

      <title>Assignments and Commitments Page</title>

      <para>The assignments and commitments page enables planners to explore
      the task assignments and information sharing commitments (IS procedures)
      computed by Channels for a plan.</para>

      <para>A planner first enters focus and summarization parameters for the
      generation of the visualization of tasks assignments and information
      sharing commitments. A planner then requests the visualization.</para>

      <para>The focus parameters are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>A choice of viewing the IS procedures generated from one
            segment or from the entire plan</para>

            aggregate of agents) for which to generate IS procedures</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>The summarization parameter determines how to aggregate, if at
      all, the task assignments of those other than the focused-on agent or
      organization. The choices are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>By organization - aggregate task assignments by
            organizations</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>By organization and role- aggregate task assignments by
            roles in organizations</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>By type of organization and role- aggregate task assignments

            agents</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>Summarizing by type of organization and for a single segment
      minimizes the size of the visualization. Requesting to see the
      procedures for the entire plan and without summarization can yield very
      large visualizations that might take a while to display.</para>

      <para>A planner can also request a drill-down report view of all (and
      only) the task assignments and sharing commitments shown in the
      visualization. At the top level of the report, all triggers for assigned
      tasks are listed and organized by events, by phases, and by how they are
      triggered (notification, request, automatically). The lists are
      initially collapsed and can be expanded.</para>

    <title>The ISP Method</title>

    <para>Channels enables information sharing planners to apply the ISP
    Method, an incremental and nonlinear process for building information
    sharing plans from which useful analytics and robust information sharing
    procedures can be generated.</para>

    <para>IS analytics enable planners to better understand the consequences
    and weaknesses of a plan while IS procedures enable participating
    organizations to more reliably fulfill their missions through information
    sharing, before, during, and/or after one or more events of
    significance.</para>

      <title>ISP Method and ISP Process</title>

      <para>The ISP Method is encompassed by the ISP Process. The ISP Process
      includes the ISP Method and adds best practices for the successful
      promotion, definition, initiation, implementation, and review of
      information sharing planning projects. The ISP Process, other than its
      significance to the ISP Method, is outside the scope of this
      document.</para>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>The ISP Method is defined in terms of the ISP concepts covered
      earlier and of ISP Method activities (activities for short). These
      activities should not be confused with ISP Process best practices. For
      example, a ISP best practice might help planners decide what the scope
      an IS plan should be, whereas a plan scoping activity would indicate any
      prerequisite activities, prescribe how to capture the scope of a plan
      (once decided upon), and indicate what further activities could follow
      up changes to the scope.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Building an Information Sharing Plan</title>

      <para>An IS plan is built by information sharing planners (planners) who
      carry out activities defined in the ISP Method in order to move the plan
      toward completion and also increase its value.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Overview of the ISP Method activities</title>

        <para>Activities alter the scope of an IS plan, bring the plan closer
        to completion, or improve the quality and value of the IS procedures
        generated from the plan.</para>

        <para>Activities are organized into four groups:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Scoping</emphasis> an IS plan initiates the
              building of an IS plan, but these activities can also be
              reapplied at any time, whenever the scope needs to
              change.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Specifying</emphasis> IS procedures by defining
              tasks and information flows from which the procedures are
              computed</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Profiling</emphasis> referenced entitites includ
              types of events, roles, phases and transmission media, or actual
              or types of organizations, places, and agents</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Improving</emphasis> the IS plan by making it
              more manageable, robust, complete, and reusable</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>There is no fixed, prescribed order to the execution of ISP
        Method activities. Scope can be modified at any time while an IS plan
        is being built. Tasks and information flows can also be added,
        removed, or modified at any point in time. Entities can be profiled as
        soon they are mentioned by name and they can be named at any time. An
        IS Plan can and should be improved early and often in order to keep it
        as manageable and as valuable as possible.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Issues</title>

        <para>The ISP Method defines a relatively large number (90+) of issues
        that can be detected in an IS plan. They are categorized as:</para>

        <itemizedlist>

        segment, a task, a flow, an entity, or any other kind of plan
        element.</para>

        <para>An issue can be assigned a severity of minor, major, severe, or
        extreme. The severity of an issue is either preset according to the
        kind of issue (for example, an information flow without elements of
        information is always a major issue), or computed by determining the
        most severe risk mitigation or gain capture that could be foiled by a
        cascade of failures caused by the issue.</para>

        <para>An issue comes with one or more alternate options for its
        remediation. A planner can elect to launch a survey to gather opinions
        on how to remediate an issue.</para>

        <title>Moving an IS plan to completion</title>

        <para>When is an IS plan complete? There is really no satisfactory
        answer to this question. Because one could always increase the scope
        of a plan, a more useful question would be: Given its current scope,
        is there something clearly missing from a plan? If the answer is no,
        then the plan can be deemed “complete.”</para>

        <para>Knowing whether the scope of an IS plan is properly set requires
        knowing the domains of human endeavor involved and being able to
        identify the organizations that ought to participate in the plan.
        Absent this knowledge, software can only examine an IS plan to detect
        what is inherently missing from it.</para>

          </itemizedlist>The scope of an IS plan can be changed even after it
        is deemed complete. Tasks, flows, and entities that do not contribute
        to completing a plan are considered redundant. Redundant tasks, flows,
        or entities should be removed from a plan. If the scope of a plan is
        reduced, some elements of a plan may become redundant as a

            <para><emphasis>Goal-driven</emphasis> strategy - Add

          <para>Planners look at each organizational goal attached to a phase
          of an anticipated event, add tasks that achieve it, and add the
          information needs of each of these tasks. They then add tasks that
          produce the needed information and connect the tasks with
          information flows. This process continues until all goals are

          tasks and flows, and consequently the IS procedures generated from
          them, are within the scope of the IS plan, because all tasks and
          flows contribute directly or indirectly to addressing identified
          goals. However, this strategy alone does not guarantee that tasks
          triggered by the start of event phases will be included. In other
          words, this "working from the end" strategy does not guarantee that
          it will reach all starting points.</para>

          indicate whether tasks initiate or terminate events. This process
          continues until no task gets triggered or terminated by information
          produced by specified tasks, and all event phases are

          <para>Systematic use of an effect-driven strategy is akin to telling
          a story from beginning to end, and thus may feel more natural to
          many planners. However some tasks and flows added using this
          strategy might not necessarily contribute directly or indirectly to
          achieving identified goals. In other words, a "starting from the
          beginning" strategy does not guarantee that it will reach all
          required end points.</para>

          <para>When using an issue-driven strategy, planners scan the list of

      <para>An ISP Method activity is carried out by an IS planner either to
      correct a mistake in the definition of an IS plan, bring the plan closer
      to completion, or make it more robust.</para>

      <para>An activity is composed of a number of steps, all of which may be
      optional, often to be carried out in no particular order. Most
      activities can be undone (for example, a task added to the IS plan can
      be later removed). Prerequisites for an activity, if there are any, are
      usually few and commonsensical. For example, a task in a segment cannot
      be specified unless the segment is already defined.</para>

      <para>Note that for each "Add ..." activity there is usually an implied
      and related "Remove ..." and "Modify ..." activity. For example, "Add
      task" implies "Remove task" and "Modify task".</para>

      <para>Prior to applying any activity, it is assumed that:</para>

          <title>Identifying an event as an incident</title>

          <para>The scope of an IS plan is largely set by identifying the
          types of anticipated events that are of concern. An event is
          considered an "incident" if it is unplanned (no task within the plan
          is expected to cause it). An IS plan always has at least one
          incident event within its scope. When an IS plan is created, an
          "unnamed" event is put in its list of incidents.</para>

          <para>When an IS plan is created, Channels automatically defines a
          "co-event" phase and calls it "Responding." If planners want to also
          plan for the "before" or "after" of events, they need to add them to
          the scope of the plan by naming them in the Details view of the plan
          definition panel. Planners can also rename the default "Responding"
          phase to anything they want. A phase that is not referenced
          anywhere, other than in the plan's Details view, can be removed from
          the scope.</para>

          <title>Identifying a participating agent</title>

          <para role="aspect">The scope of an IS plan includes not only
          participating organizations but also participating agents, that is,
          agents as role-playing members of organizations that can be assigned
          to tasks. Agents "employed by organizations" are added to the scope
          implicitly from the definitions of tasks, or explicitly by defining
          the "jobs" of participating organizations that are relevant to the
          plan.</para>

          <para>Since it is a best practice not to directly identify the
          assignees of tasks but rather to specify them via their roles in
          types of organizations, the preferred approach for identifying
          participating agents is to list them with their jobs in the profiles
          of participating organizations.</para>

          <para>An agent is further identified by associating one or more
          users to it. The meaning of associating a user to an actual agent
          depends on whether the agent is designated as an archetype, a
          placeholder, or (the default) a normal agent.</para>

          <para>An archetype agent captures the notion of a group of anonymous
          and indistinguishable agents (same contact info, same roles in the
          same organizations). An "ACME Call Center Agent" would be an
          archetype playing the role of "Call Center Agent" for the
          organization "ACME" and with some 1-800 number as its communication
          channel. Any number of Channels users can be associated with an
          archetype. These users all receive the IS guidelines of their
          associated archetype.</para>

          <para>A placeholder agent is an agent whose identity is to be given
          via their associations with users. A placeholder agent can be given
          default contact information that the associated user(s) can override
          and add to. A placeholder agent can be restricted to only one
          associated user or can be open to associations with many users. A
          user associated with a placeholder agent gets the IS guidelines of
          that agent, with the user's contact info
          substitutions/additions.</para>

          <para>The default kind of actual agent directly identifies the
          person or system and provides contact information as part of the
          profile. Only one user can be associated by planners with a normal,
          actual agent. The full name of the user and of the agent are
          expected to match (an issue is raised if not). The associated user
          gets the agent's IS guidelines. It is an ISP best practice to define
          agents, as much as possible, either as archetypes or as
          placeholders.</para>

          <para role="aspect">The information sharing model of an IS plan is
          composed of segments, each focusing on one phase of one event,

          flow-connected tasks. Adding a segment contributes to setting the
          scope of a plan, because doing so is a prerequisite to adding
          organizational goals that contribute to the scope.</para>

          classification levels of elements of information. When an IS plan is

          <para>The incoming flows of a task implicitly define satisfied needs
          for the task. By adding an explicit information need to a task, a
          planner defines an information requirement of the task that may or
          may not be satisfied by incoming flows. The planner also indicates
          that incoming flows partially satisfying or completing this
          information need are not necessarily the only acceptable sources.
          Channels looks at the information needs and information capabilities
          of tasks to uncover missed opportunities for information sharing
          (see "Satisfy all needs" in the Commands section).</para>

          <para>Note that only the explicit information needs of a task are
          visible across segments and offered as candidate targets for
          cross-segment flows. (Software types might want to think of
          information needs and information capabilities as defining the
          "interfaces of a segment.")</para>

          <para>The outgoing flows of a task implicitly define information
          capabilities (ability and willingness to share) for the task. By
          adding an explicit information capability to a task, a planner
          defines information produced or acquired by the execution of the
          task that may or may not be shared to satisfy the information needs
          of other tasks. The planner also indicates that the targets of
          outgoing flows of the same name are not necessarily the only
          acceptable tasks the information can be shared with. Channels looks
          at information needs and information capabilities of tasks to
          uncover missed opportunities for information sharing (see "Satisfy
          all needs" in the Commands section).</para>

          <para>Note that only the explicit information capabilities of a task
          are visible across segments and offered as candidate sources for
          cross-segment flows.</para>

          <title>Connecting tasks with an information flow</title>

          <para>A planner connects two tasks with an information flow to
          express the requirement that agents executing the source task commit
          to share information with agents executing the target task, possibly
          subject to some restrictions. The information is either produced by
          or acquired for the execution of the source task, and the
          information is to be used for the execution of the target task. The
          same flow appears to the source task in its list of "sends" and to
          the target task in its list of "receives".</para>

          <para>A planner connects a source and target task by doing any of
          the following:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Opening an information capability of the source-to-be
                task and identifying or creating the target task in the "To
                task" field. The target task can be created in situ by
                selecting "Other..." in the list of candidate target tasks and
                naming a task that does not yet exist within the
                segment.</para>

                <para>If the flow is between tasks in the same segment, the
                information need is converted into an information flow; to
                preserve the information need, the planner must duplicate it
                and set the source on only the copy or the original. If the
                flow is between tasks in different segments, the information
                need is preserved when the flow is created.</para>

                duplicate it and set the target on only the copy or the
                original. If the flow is between tasks in different segments,

        <title>Profiling entities</title>

        <para>In ISP, entities encompass the "static elements" in IS plans
        that can be unambiguously identified and thus uniquely named. ISP
        entities are events, phases (of events), agents (people or systems),
        organizations, roles, places, and communication media (phone, email,
        etc.) Tasks and flows are not entities because they are neither static
        (they are what agents do) nor are they uniquely named.</para>

        <para>Entities are referenced by name in the definitions of a plan,
        plan segments, tasks, flows, and in the definitions of other entities.
        An entity is created the first time it is named and is removed when no
        longer referenced (immediately if its definition is empty).</para>

        <para>Entities can be "actual" or "types". An "actual" entity
        represents a physical reality, whereas a "type of entity" represents a
        category of entity. "John Doe" would be an actual agent, whereas
        "Adult" would be a type of agent. "The United Nations" is an actual
        organization, whereas "International Governing Body" is a type of
        organization. And so on. Some kinds of entities can only be types in
        an IS plan, namely events, phases, roles, and communication media. ISP
        does not deal with actual events, only with types of anticipated
        events. Roles, phases, and communication media are inherently
        categories.</para>

        <para>Planners can define (profile) an entity as soon as it is first
        referenced by giving values to some or all of the entity's attributes.
        All entities, be they types or actual, have a few attributes in
        common:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Name - set when first referenced and changeable at any
              time</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Description - short, unstructured text</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Tags - a list of tags used for ad hoc grouping of plan
              elements</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Categories - a list of same-kind entity types (an agent is
              categorized by agent types, a role is categorized by other
              roles, etc.)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Documentation (attached image, reference document,
              etc.)</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>Of these common attributes, categories are particularly
        important. How an agent, role, place, organization, etc. is
        categorized can have wide-ranging consequences on how tasks, which are
        typically defined in terms of entity types, are assigned, and thus on
        what information sharing commitments are computed from an IS plan. A
        small change in the categorization of an organization or a role can
        significantly alter the IS procedures implied in an IS plan.</para>

        <para>Most kinds of entities have their own idiosyncratic attributes.
        For example, an actual organization can have a parent organization, an
        actual agent can have security clearances, a communication medium
        might delegate transmissions to other media, etc. The Profiling
        activities of the ISP Method describe what these attributes are and
        give their meanings.</para>

        <para>Entity profiles are accessed in different ways. An entity's
        profile can be accessed in Channels<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>From wherever it is named as part of the definition of a

          clearances, if any, are examined when the agent is the beneficiary

          <title>Profiling a transmission medium</title>

          <para role="aspect">A transmission medium is a means by which
          information can be shared. The means may involve technology (phone,
          instant messaging, email, etc.) or it may not (face-to-face). A
          communication channel is a transmission medium combined with an
          endpoint (aka address). For example, a communication channel might
          be "Phone" (transmission medium) with "1-800-234-5678" (endpoint),
          or "email" with "jane.doe@example.com".</para>

        <title>Improving a plan</title>

        <para>A number of ISP Method activities do not change the scope of an
        IS plan nor do they add elements to it, but rather are concerned with
        improving the plan overall. A plan is improved either by better
        distributing tasks and flows across segments, by generalizing a task's
        definition to increase the number of agents that are assignable to it,
        or by making changes to entity typologies that have wide-ranging
        effects on the generation of IS procedures.</para>

          <title>Moving tasks across segments</title>

          <para role="aspect">An IS plan is a collection of segments, each
          focusing on a specific situation, namely, one phase of one event,
          possibly in the context of other current or past events. Segments
          are usually inter-connected both by flows that connect two tasks in
          different segments, and by the fact that a task in one segment may
          trigger the situation that is the focus of another segment.</para>

          <para>Each segment addresses one or more risks to or opportunities
          for organizations (goals) for a given situation. As more goals are
          added to the scope, more tasks are needed to achieve them and to
          provide needed information. A segment could grow to become quite
          large and difficult to manage (the flow maps become oversized, the
          list of completeness issues for the segment become hard to track,
          etc.)</para>

          <para>A solution is to create a new segment, move to the new segment
          tasks from the large segment that achieve or help achieve a goal,
          and then remove the goal from the initial segment.</para>

          <para>Channels provides a simple and safe mechanism for moving
          selected tasks all at once to another segment while keeping them
          connected with their flows. Goals listed in moved tasks are added as
          needed to the destination segment. Moving tasks is a reversible
          (undo-able) change.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Generalizing a task's definition</title>

          <para>Sometimes the assignees of a task are specified too narrowly
          in the definition of the task, possibly because an organization is
          identified by name in the definition, or because the role given is
          too specific. It can also be the case that an IS plan contains
          multiple tasks, each with the same name but with different, narrowly
          defined assignee specifications, that could be replaced by a single
          task with more broadly specified assignees.</para>

          <para>However, when two broadly defined tasks are connected by a
          flow, many of the implied information sharing commitments may be
          inappropriate. For example, assignees to both the source and target
          tasks of a flow may be from different organizations (organization
          types were used to specify task assignees). If the intent was for
          task assignees to communicate only with co-workers, then a planner
          must put in a restriction on the flow stating that sharing
          commitments are only between agents in the same organization. The
          alternative is to define multiple source and target tasks, each
          narrowly assigned to members of only one organization (but otherwise
          identically named pair-wise), and connect them with flows of the
          same name.</para>

          <para>It is an ISP best practice to avoid as much as possible having
          multiple tasks of the same name in the same segment, except for
          purposes of overriding tasks and/or flows (see section on Overriding
          tasks and flows). Generalizing task assignee specifications combined
          with flow restrictions can greatly reduce the number of tasks and
          flows in an IS plan, thus making it more manageable and easier to
          grow.</para>

          <title>Changing the categorization of an entity</title>

          <para>Entity types can themselves be categorized by other entity
          types. For example, a "Rail station" (a place entity type) can be
          categorized as a "Building" (another place entity type) and as a
          "Transit system node" (another place entity type). The
          categorization of entity types together creates typologies. Because
          tasks can be defined in terms of entity types (agent types, roles,
          place types, organization types), small changes to entity typologies
          can have wide-ranging effects on task assignments, and thus
          information sharing commitments.</para>

          <para>It is highly recommended that planners
              frequently look up typologies (agent typology, event
                typology, role typology, etc.) to make sure that each
                represents an intended conceptualization of the plan's
                environment and check the assignments calculated for tasks that are
                affected by the change.</para>

        <title>Commands</title>

        <para>Planners carry out ISP activities in Channels by executing
        Channels commands. Any change to an IS plan is the result of executing
        a command. Planners execute commands in Channels whenever they create
        and remove segments; when they add, cut, copy and paste tasks, needs,
        capabilities and flows; connect tasks with information flows,
        disconnect them, add an issue, remove a segment, move tasks across
        segments, add an intermediate to a flow, etc.</para>

        <para>Some commands are directly triggered from “actions” menus within
        the context of a plan, segment, task, flow, or entity. Other commands
        are triggered by updating fields in edit forms, or by pressing
        buttons.</para>

        <para>Some commands have simple effects (adding a task, for example)
        but others can be more complex:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>“Disintermediate” removes a task that acts as a middleman in
            a flow</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>“Intermediate” adds a middleman task to a flow</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>“Satisfy all needs” automatically connects information needs
            of a task to matching but untapped information capabilities from
            other tasks</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>"Move tasks" moves one or more tasks from one segment to
            another, possibly also adding goals achieved by the moved tasks to
            the target segment</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Complex commands are defined in terms of other commands that are
        executed completely or not at all. Most commands are reversible and
        can be undone and redone up and until some planner takes an action
        that would conflict with the undoing or redoing (for example, anyone
        removing a task prevents a planner from undoing a change he/she
        recently did to one of its attributes).</para>

        <para>The execution of each command is journaled for replay should the
        server be interrupted and restarted. It is also recorded and listed in
        the activities tab in the collaboration panel. Channels makes sure
        that only one command is being executed on an IS plan at a time, no
        matter how many planners are working on a plan.</para>
