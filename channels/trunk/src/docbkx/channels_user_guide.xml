      <title>Why Plan the Sharing of Information?</title>

      <para>Most organizations now operate in complex "ecosystems" where they depend on each other
        for information critical to their missions. It is common wisdom that getting the right
        information at the right time is essential to achieving mission success. This is even more
        so in a connected world where opportunities can be fleeting and risks can spread not only
        quickly but far and wide.</para>

      <para>Yet most organizations do not plan how they should share information within and across
        organizational boundaries. It is something of a paradox that while they will plan their
        finances or model their business processes to achieve greater efficiency, they will rarely
        determine how they need to communicate to better prevent, respond or recover from
        crises.</para>

      <para>Failure to plan how information should flow can cost lives, money, reputation. During a
        crisis, information will not spontaneously flow as needed, and maintaining contact lists is
        clearly not enough. Organizations must prepare and create actionable information sharing
        plans. Information sharing can and should be planned not only in order to be prepared but
        also to effectively retain and disseminate communication best practices.</para>

      <para><emphasis>Information Sharing Planning (ISP) models, analyzes and deploys information
          sharing best practices so that organizations can more effectively mitigate systemic risks
          and seize opportunities from anticipated events. </emphasis></para>

      <para>ISP provides a framework and method for designing and improving the information sharing
        practices required by networked organizations to achieve their missions.</para>

      <title>Why Use Channels to Plan Information Sharing?</title>

      <para>Planners use Channels, a Web application, to jointly build information sharing plans (IS
        plans). Planning information sharing is done in preparation of anticipated events. Channels
        is <emphasis role="italic">not</emphasis> meant for managing the actual sharing of
        information during a crisis.</para>

      <para>When building IS plans using Channels, planners clarify and uncover:</para>

      <title>IS practices and environment</title>
      <para>Building an IS plan in Channels can be divided into<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>modeling information sharing practices (IS practices)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>

              apply to</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>When modeling IS practices, planners describe what <emphasis>kind</emphasis> of people
        and systems (or <firstterm>agents</firstterm>) are to be assigned to planned tasks. More
        importantly, planners describe what information would be acquired by the execution of a task
        and then shared with others who need it to carry out their own tasks. A model of IS would
        normally not identify task assignees by name, but rather specify them by their roles,
        qualifications, and/or jurisdictions and by the types of organizations they belong
        to.</para>

      <para>When entering the profiles of people, systems, and organizations into an IS plan,
        planners do so with the expectation that profiles will match the descriptions of task
        assignees. Once assigned to a task, an agent can become committed to sharing information
        acquired by executing the task as specified by the (modeled) IS practices.</para>

      <para>All modeling is done via input forms. Some forms (for defining tasks, receives and
        sends) have both a simple and advanced formats. The simple formats shows the most frequently
        filled-in subset of all fields. </para>

      <para>From the moment an IS plan is created, it can be visualized, analyzed and diagnosed,
        albeit to little effect until it has been sufficiently built up.</para>
      <para>By using Channels to build IS plans, planners produce:</para>

      <para>A model of information sharing practices is visualized primarily as information flow
        maps where tasks are connected by information sharing flows. Each information flow specifies

        information-producing task need to make with agents executing the information-consuming
        task.</para>

      <title>Issue detection</title>
      <para>Channels automatically detects issues in an IS plan (upwards of 100 different types of
        issues). Issues are communicated to planners visually (tasks and flows drawn in red) and in
        other ways as well (issues panels throughout, all-issues table, issues summary report). The
        entire set of outstanding issues is recalculated with every change planners make to the
        plan. Planners can manually indicate issues that Channels cannot detect, usually because the
        specific issues involve domain knowledge.</para>

      <para>An issue has a description, a list of suggested remediations, and a severity level
        (minor, major, severe, extreme). The severity of an issue is either a constant for the type
        of issue, or it is calculated from the potential cascade of task failures attributable to
        the issue, in which case the severity is set by the most severe risk not mitigated or the
        most valuable gain not realized because of the failure.</para>

      <title>Failure impact analysis</title>
      <para>Issue diagnostics is one of many kinds of analysis Channels performs on an IS plan.

        task not be performed or should some information not be shared as planned.</para>

      <title>Information sharing should also be planned</title>
      <para>While the effort required to model IS practices far exceeds that of simply drawing
        information flow maps using a drawing tool, the benefits of modeling IS practices using
        Channels are substantial and include the automated generation of personalized IS guidelines,
        issue detection, and analyses that illuminate the properties and consequences of applying
        these practices.</para>

      <title>Information sharing plan</title>
      <db:para>In order to productively use Channels, a planner must first have a clear, conceptual
        understanding of Information Sharing Planning.</db:para>
      <para>An <firstterm linkend="information_sharing_plan">Information Sharing Plan (IS
          Plan)</firstterm> specifies the <firstterm>information sharing commitments</firstterm>
        required of people and systems (<firstterm linkend="agent">agents</firstterm>) in <firstterm
          linkend="role">roles</firstterm> of responsibility to fulfill the missions of their
          <firstterm linkend="organization">organizations</firstterm>, before, during, and/or after
          <firstterm linkend="event">events</firstterm> that test their missions.</para>
      <para>Agents achieve goals that fulfill their organizations' missions by executing,
        individually or as teams, <firstterm>tasks</firstterm> that are assigned to them. By
        executing their assigned tasks, agents directly manage <firstterm linkend="risk"
          >risks</firstterm>, achieve <firstterm linkend="gain">gains</firstterm>, and/or produce
        information needed by other tasks. <firstterm linkend="information_sharing_flow">Information
          sharing flows</firstterm> connect tasks that produce information with tasks that need it.
        Information can be shared between people, people and systems, or between systems, over
          <firstterm linkend="transmission_medium">transmission media</firstterm> or face-to-face.
        Sharing can be subject to <firstterm linkend="policy">policies</firstterm>.</para>
      <para>When planners define a task, they either identify or characterize the agents to be
        assigned to it. Characterizing task assignees can be done more or less broadly by specifying
        them in terms of their organizations, <firstterm>roles</firstterm>,
          <firstterm>qualifications</firstterm> and/or <firstterm>jurisdictions</firstterm>. Agents
        can be bound by information sharing commitments whenever they are assigned to tasks that are
        connected by flows to other tasks. Agents commit to share <firstterm linkend="information"
          >information</firstterm> they acquire when doing a task with some or all agents who
        execute flow-connected tasks. Recipient agents implicitly agree not to use the information
        for other purposes.</para>

      <para>It is important to understand that an information sharing plan is not an
          <emphasis>action</emphasis> plan. Unlike Business Process Modeling, the objective of
        Information Sharing Planning (ISP) is not to optimize, script, or automate activities. The
        overarching objective of building an IS plan is to ensure that information does flow as
        required in order to successfully manage risks and capture opportunities.</para>
      <para>Task precedence is however not entirely absent from an IS plan. A task triggered by
        information requires the prior execution of another task producing it. Such precedence
        constraints do not typically apply to all tasks in an IS plan, and thus an IS plan will most
        often not dictate a unique sequence for all tasks.</para>
      <para>This is a good thing. Attempting to define a precisely orchestrated action plan for
        organizations without a central authority is almost always an exercise in futility. So,
        while an IS plan certainly captures what needs to be done, the focus is squarely on how
        information needs to flow to ensure that mission-accomplishing tasks are successful.
          <emphasis role="italic">The details of exactly how these tasks are to be executed is
          currently outside the scope of an ISP model.</emphasis></para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>IS plan = IS practices + environment</title>
      <para>An IS plan can be understood as applying <firstterm>information sharing
          practices</firstterm> to an <firstterm>environment</firstterm>. Information sharing
        practices are definitions of information-producing and consuming tasks connected by
        information flows. An environment enumerates agents (people and systems) in roles of
        responsibility within organizations. These agents are assigned to flow-connected tasks and,
        as a consequence, have information sharing commitments.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Flow-connected tasks in the IS practices model of an IS plan</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>In order to separate (decouple) IS practices and environment, it is recommended to model
        IS practices without mentioning actual organizations, people, or systems when characterizing
        task assignees. It is best to define tasks as being executed by "disembodied" roles from
          <emphasis>types</emphasis> of organizations (e.g. a "forensic autopsy" is to be carried by
        a "coroner" from a "county health office"). IS practices models that are not attached to a
        particular environment can be applied, possibly with some local adaptations, to more than
        one environment.</para>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>An IS plan's environment identifies the actual people or systems that play the
        organizational roles mentioned in the IS practices model (or IS model for short). For
        example, planners could build an IS model for responding to an epidemic outbreak at the
        state level, and then apply the same IS model to different states, each state being a
        different environment with its own organizations and role-assigned agents.</para>
      <para>Note that there is not yet explicit support in the current release of Channels for
        separately managing the IS model and environment of an IS plan, or for explicitly composing
        IS plans by applying one reusable IS model to different environments. A future release of
        Channels will provide such support. In the meanwhile, planners are strongly encouraged to
        follow the above best practice of keeping the IS model as decoupled as possible from the IS
        plan's environment.</para>

      <section>
        <title>What is the scope of an IS plan?</title>
        <para>The scope of an IS plan is primarily set by 1- identifying the events of significance
          the plan must address, 2- identifying the organizations and their agents that participate
          in the plan, and 3- specifying via <firstterm>information sharing requirements</firstterm>
          the information sharing commitments expected between participating organizations (see
          "Scoping a Plan" in the "Activities" section of the "ISP Method" chapter) . </para>

        <title>Information sharing requirements</title>
        <db:para>When Planners define IS requirements on a plan, Channels determines which

          commitments "network" that the IS plan is <emphasis role="italic">expected</emphasis> to
          produce. Channels also compares the IS commitments computed from the plan against the
          expected network to evaluate how well each organization satisfies the requirements that

      <section>
        <title>Events in scope</title>
        <para>An IS plan of manageable scope normally addresses only a limited number of anticipated
          events. An event of significance (or event, for short) is something that changes the state
          of the world for some time in ways that challenge the mission of one or more organizations
          by introducing risks or by creating opportunities for gains. Organizations assign their
          agents to tasks that mitigate these risks or make these gains. An event can bring
          different risks or opportunities to different organizations. For example, an explosion at
          a refinery, clearly an event of significance, would endanger the lives of workers, would
          likely cause financial losses to insurers, but could also create an opportunity for
          commodity traders to profit financially.</para>
        <para>The events in an IS plan are not actual events that did or could occur at specific
          times and locations. Channels is, after all, strictly meant for planning, not for managing
          ongoing responses. Events in Channels are implicitly <emphasis>types</emphasis> of events

        <para>Risks and opportunities can be addressed in the time before, during, or after
            <firstterm>phases</firstterm> of an event (<firstterm>event phases</firstterm>).
          Typically the purpose of tasks and information sharing in a "before" phase of an event
          will be to cause or prevent events. Tasks and information sharing planned for a "during"
          phase of an event will normally be about responding to the event as it is unfolding in
          order to minimize its negative consequences or maximize positive outcomes. In an "after"
          phase, it will often be about recovering from the aftermath of an event, or reaping its
          rewards.</para>

        <title>Controlling scope</title>
        <para>An IS plan will typically focus on at least one, and at most a few, events of
          significance, and concern itself with one or more phases for each of these events. Events
          within the scope of a plan are a combination of events that happen outside the control of
          the participants of the plan (so-called <emphasis>incidents</emphasis>) and of events
          caused by planned tasks (and thus under the control of participants).</para>

        </figure>
        <para>An IS plan should also address only a small, manageable number of organizational risks
          or opportunities stemming from events in scope. It is recommended, when starting on a new
          IS plan, not to involve too many organizations having too many goals in too many phases of
          too many events. It is better to start small and focused and then grow only as
          needed.</para>

        <title>Segments: Divide and conquer</title>
        <para>Information sharing plans typically deal with more than one event phase, and they can
          involve a sizable number of organizations. Because plans can become quite large, planners
          break them into smaller, more manageable units of planning called
            <firstterm>segments</firstterm>. When an IS plan is created, it is given a first segment
          that, by default, responds to an unnamed event. An IS plan always has at least one segment
          and planners always work within one segment or another.</para>

        <para>Each IS plan <glossterm>segment</glossterm> covers one <emphasis role="italic"
            >scenario</emphasis>, namely, one phase of one event, possibly in the context of some
          other past or currents events. For example, a segment might address responding to a "stock
          price rally" during "a volatile market" and after a prior "hostile takeover
          attempt".</para>
        <para>A segment might put in scope only some of the organizational risks and gain
          opportunities associated with the scenario it covers. In other words, more than one
          segment may cover to the same scenario butwith each segment addressing a different list of
          organizational goals. Two segments should not address the same goal for the same
          scenario.</para>

        </figure>
        <para>A segment is expected to address one or more organizational goals stemming from the
          scenario. A <emphasis>goal</emphasis> is either a risk to an organization (or type of
          organization) to be mitigated, or a gain to be realized by an organization (or type of
          organization). Each risk is categorized from a list of types of risks derived from
          combining actuarial risk management taxonomies. Each gain is also categorized from a list
          that is the "mirror image" of the risk types. Risks are rated as minor, major, severe, or
          extreme. Gains are rated as low, medium, high, or highest. Planners can indicate if a risk
          is implicitly mitigated or a gain implicitly realized when the scenario covered by the
          segment concludes.</para>
        <para>A task or flow in an IS plan belongs to one and only one segment. A segment should
          contain all the flow-enabled tasks that directly achieve the segment's goals, plus flows
          and tasks the goal-achieving tasks depend on, directly or indirectly to start, terminate,
          or succeed.</para>

        <para>Segments are normally not disconnected; flows usually connect one or more tasks in one
          segment to tasks in another. Furthermore a task in one segment might initiate the scenario
          addressed by the other segment either by causing an event or by terminating it. Initiation
          of an event marks the beginning of the "during" phase of that event and marks the end of
          its "before" phase. Termination of an event marks the start of the "after" phase of that
          event (for example, terminating a fire event starts the fire recovery phase).</para>

        <title>Tasks</title>
        <para>Flows (short for information sharing flows) and the tasks they connect are the
          building blocks of the IS practices model in an IS plan. </para>
        <para>A task describes an action to be carried out at some location and for some purpose by
          one or more agents. Agents assigned to tasks fulfill the responsibilities of the roles
          bestowed upon them by organizations that employ them. </para>
        <para>The agents that ought to be assigned to a task are described by any combination of
          name, role, jurisdiction, and organization. Ideally, the agents of a task will not be
          identified but profiled (for example, by role and type of organization only) in the
          definition of the task so that more than one person or system, but only the intended ones,
          will match the profile and get assigned to the task. </para>
        <para>According to a task's definition, those assigned to the task are expected to carry it
          out either as a team or on their own. The timing aspects of a task execution can be given,
          namely, how long the task takes to complete and how soon it repeats, if at all. A task
          might cause or prevent an event.</para>

        <para>A task can have <firstterm>information needs</firstterm> (information agents require
          to execute the task), <firstterm>information capabilities</firstterm> (information
          acquired by the execution of the task that can then be shared), or both. An information
          flow implicitly specifies an information need of the receiving task and implicitly
          specifies an information capability of the sending task. Unless one or more matching
          information needs are defined on the receiving task, a flow always satisfies the
          information need it implies. Planners can explicitly define the information needs and
          capabilities of a task.</para>
        <para>Explicitly specifying an information need of a task allows Channels to automatically

      <title>Entities</title>
      <para>An IS plan references by name various agents, places, roles, organizations, events,
        transmission media and phases of events. These are referred to in ISP as entities. An ISP
        entity is anything that can be named in an IS plan but is neither a task nor information (or
        an element thereof). An ISP entity is always unambiguously referenced by name in a plan, its
        segments, tasks, and flows, or in the profiles of other entities. There can only be one
        agent named "John Doe", only one event named "Lawsuit filed," etc. in a given plan.</para>

        <para>There are <emphasis role="italic">actual</emphasis> entities and there are <emphasis

          “Morristown, Morris County, NJ, USA,” etc.) are categorized by types of entities (“Senior
          executive”, “Corporation”, “City” etc.). Entity types can refine other entity types (a
          “Senior executive” is a kind of “Executive” which is a kind of "Employee").</para>
        <para>Actual entities can be categorized by entity types of the same kind (agents are

        <title>Agents</title>
        <para>An <glossterm>agent</glossterm> is either a person or an information system (system
          for short). An agent is capable of sending or receiving notifications and sending and
          answering queries. An agent has contact information and availability (24/7 by default). An
          agent's clearance is a list of secrecy classifications (e.g., NATO Top Secret and US Gov.
          Secret). An agent can communicate in one or languages (if none are given, the agent can
          communicate in the IS plan's default language).</para>
        <para>An agent <emphasis role="italic">type</emphasis> can be thought of as a qualification
          that can be shared by different agents (e.g., "Adult" or "Registered driver"). An agent
          type is not to be confused with a role. A role implies responsibilities, whereas an agent
          type denotes qualifications or status.</para>
        <para>An agent can be flagged as a system (non-human).</para>
        <db:para>Users participate in a plan when they are associated with one or more agents in
          that plan. The profile of an agent sets the modalities for associating users to the agent. </db:para>
        <db:para>If participation as the agent is open to all users of the plan, then any user can
          effect the association. If not, only planners can do so. The ability of a user to
          participate as an "open" agent can be restricted to users already associated to another
          agent with a common employer. For example, the " An ACME floor warden" agent should only
          be open to users participating as another agent employed by ACME.</db:para>
        <db:para>An agent can be restricted to having only one user associated with it. Otherwise,
          any number of users can participate as that agent. For example, any number of users should
          be able to participate as the "A citizen of New York City" agent.</db:para>
        <para>The agent's profile can indicate that the users participating as the agent are
          indistinguishable from each other (for example, call center operators), that is, they
          participate anonymously. Anonymous participation means that the identities and the
          personal contact information of the users are not added to the plan's environment and thus
          do not appear in information sharing guidelines.</para>

          organization upon an agent acting on behalf of the organization. A role assigned to an
          agent may be restricted to a jurisdiction (a place). A role is always an entity type.
          Roles are referenced primarily in task definitions and in organization profiles (the roles

        <para>A <glossterm>transmission medium</glossterm> is a means by which agents transmit
          information with each other. Transmission media may or may not be technology-based. A
          medium is either unicast (transmits to a single, known agent), multicast (transmits at
          once to multiple, known agents), or broadcast (little to no control over the potential
          multitude who receive the transmission).</para>
        <para>A transmission medium can delegate transmissions to other media. For example, VoIP can
          interface with Telephones. The security of a medium is expressed in terms of secrecy
          classifications. A transmission medium is always an entity type. Transmission media are
          referenced in the definitions of communication channels. Communication channels are used
          to define information flows, needs and capabilities, and the contact information of agents
          and organizations.</para>

      <title>The meaning of information in ISP</title>
      <para>As discussed above, tasks and flows are defined in terms of information needed,
        uncovered and shared. Information is named and is broken into atomic elements. Each
          <firstterm>element of information</firstterm> is named, can be given security
        classifications and can be annotated with a description and handling instructions.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>Elements of information</title>
        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/eoi_transformation.png" scale="75"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>Elements of information sent from a task can be described as the result of transforming
        elements received in the execution of the task. An element of information (EOI) sent can be
        the same as an EOI received, or it can be an EOI that was received and then renamed, or it
        can be an aggregation of EOIs received (for example a count, a synthesis,etc.).</para>
      <para>An element of information is considered atomic for the purposes of a plan; it is the
        indivisible unit of transmission and transformation. The EOIs that are aggregated into
        another EOI can not be later "split apart".</para>
      <para>The plurality of an element is left ambiguous. For example, if "suspicious activity
        report" information contains the element "suspect profile," then it is possible that there
        will be more than one suspect profile in a report.</para>
      <para>When analyzing flows, Channels is not concerned with what the information actually
        means. For example, Channels does not know what "flight status" means as it has no domain
        knowledge. Rather, it cares about whether or not two flows concern the same information, and
        whether an element of information is the same as, or is the transformation of, another
        element of information.</para>
      <para>If the information in two flows have the same name, it does not necessarily mean that
        they represent, conceptually, the same information. Two tasks performed respectively by a
        EOC commander and a corporate CEO might both need a "situation assessment," but they would
        likely not need the same kind of situation assessment with the same elements of information
        (even if the elements themselves have identical names!).</para>
      <para>In Channels, identically named flows, needs, and capabilities (uppercase vs. lowercase
        and extra spaces are ignored) are explicitly meant to represent the same kind of information
        (they are synonymous) <emphasis>if and only if</emphasis> they connect to a common task (one
        flow may be a "send" and the other one a "receive"). Similarly, identically named elements
        of information are meant to represent the same atom of information <emphasis>if only
          if</emphasis> the information they compose have the same meaning.</para>
      <para>Agents executing a task receive and send information. The information they receive and
        send may have different names yet have common elements of information. For example, the
        "suspect profile" element of a sent "suspicious activity report" may be the same as the
        "suspect description" element of a received "security tip", and it may be the same as the
        "suspect profile" of received "BOLO" information.</para>
      <para>Alternately, an element sent may aggregate elements received. Aggregation combines many
        elements into a single element, with loss of data. For example, a "suspects count" element
        aggregates "suspect profile" elements into a single number, losing the details of the
        individual profiles. Counting is only one of many possible kinds of aggregation. A "threat
        level," for example, might aggregate a great deal of different elements into a color-coded
        rating.</para>
      <para>In order to track the dissemination of information, it is necessary to indicate when
        sent elements are the result of the renaming or aggregating of received elements. Channels
        need only differentiate between those two kinds of element transformation in order to track
        the dissemination of information. The description field of an element of information can be
        used to provide more details about the specific nature of an aggregation.</para>
      <para>Issue detection takes element renaming and aggregation into account. For example, while
        it may be acceptable to declassify aggregated elements, it is not acceptable to declassify a
        renamed, classified element.</para>

      <title>Task assignments and information sharing commitments</title>
      <section>
        <title>ISP is all about commitment</title>
        <db:para>Information sharing planning with Channels boils down to specifying and generating
          the information sharing commitments that organizations need to successfully carry out
          their missions in anticipated scenarios. Note that these scenarios can be in any domain of
          human endeavor and that can be as generic or specific as desired.</db:para>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Task assignments</title>
        <db:para>Information sharing commitments are derived by first assigning agents to tasks and
          then by "networking" these agents according to the information sharing flows that
          inter-connect the tasks they are assigned to.</db:para>
        <para>A task in an IS plan is a specification of some action to be done or some decision to
          be made either all the time, upon witnessing the start or end of an event, upon receiving
          a notification or a request for information, or upon discovering or obtaining some new information. In
          defining a task, planners normally will not identify by name the actual agents to be
          assigned to it. Planners will most often characterize the agents to be assigned to the
          task in terms of their qualifications (as agent types), roles, jurisdictions (as named
          places or types of places), and/or organizations (by name or by type).</para>
        <para>A task definition will most often profile the agents that ought to be assigned to it
          instead of outright naming them. This profiling of assignable agents is best done in terms
          of roles and organization types. Such assignment profiles will then match agents known to
          the plan based on their qualifications and employments. Agents that have jobs with
          participating organizations are assigned to a task if, thanks to their profiles and their
          employments, they match the agent characterization in the task's definition. For each task
          defined, all agents within the scope of the plan are examined to see if they match and are
          to be assigned to the task. This calculation is done (very efficiently) whenever a change
          is made to the plan.</para>
        <para>Let's say a task is defined as to be carried out by all Employees (a role) at a
          Government Agency (a type of organization). Let's also say that the FBI (an actual
          organization) is categorized as both a "Law Enforcement Agency" and "Federal Agency", and
          that "Federal Agency" is categorized as a "Government Agency". Let's also say that a
          manager is a kind of employee. Then agents employed by the FBI as managers could be
          assigned to the task.</para>

        <title>Information sharing commitments</title>
        <para>Any agent assigned to a task that sends information to another task (i.e. is connected
          by a flow targeting the other task) commits to share it with some or all agents assigned
          to the task receiving the information. A task assigned to three agents with a flow
          targeting another task assigned to two agents could imply six different information
          sharing commitments, one from each assignee of the information-producing task to each
          assignee of the information-consuming task.</para>
        <para>If the flow is annotated as "to every", then the commitment is to share it with all
          assignees of the target task, otherwise the flow is "to any" and the commitment is to
          share with at least one of the assignees of the target task.</para>
        <para>Not all assignees of the "target task" are necessarily eligible to be the
          beneficiaries of information sharing commitments (commitments, for short) of each agent
          assigned to the "source" task. Commitments can be subject to restrictions or prohibitions.
          Commitments between agents can be restricted to agents in the same or different
          organization or in organizations with the same parent organizations. They can be
          restricted to agents in the same location or different location, to agents who are
          supervisors. Commitments can even be restricted to one self, which may sound odd until one
          realizes that an agent might uncover information doing a task, keep it to oneself and
          start another task on the basis of this information (an agent has in essence notified
          itself to trigger another task of his). Commitments can also be restricted to "someone
          else" or to agents in both the same organization and location.</para>

          of all task assignments for the agent plus all associated IS commitments computed by
          Channels for that agent. An agent gets his/her IS procedures from Channels in the form of
          IS guidelines.</para>

        <para>Many analytics in Channels (requirement satisfaction, dissemination, impact failure,
          network, various type of issues) depend on the computing of IS commitments for all agents
          in an IS plan. Because matching of profiles involves entity types refining other entity
          types, the proper design of typologies (for agents, roles, places, organizations etc.) is
          key to building IS plans that generate the desired IS procedures.</para>

      <title>Expressing exceptions by overriding tasks and flows</title>
      <para>It is at times necessary to express "exceptions to the rule" when modeling IS practices.
        For example, IS practices might dictate that all employees alert their supervisors if they
        become aware of suspicious activities, whereas managers, who are also employees, should not
        alert their supervisors but rather directly contact the head of security.</para>
      <para>Such exceptions in IS practices can be captured by defining overriding tasks and by
        defining prohibited flows from the overriding tasks that are otherwise equivalent to flows
        from the overridden tasks.</para>

      <title>Information sharing agreements</title>
      <para>A confirmed information sharing agreement is a formal recognition by an organization
        that information sharing commitments with other organizations covered by the agreement are
        formally endorsed, preferably as documented by an attached Memorandum of Understanding
        (MOU). A sharing commitment is by one (actual) organization toward another (actual)
        organization and is about sharing a certain kind of information (with essential elements)
        for a given purpose (task).</para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">Potential</emphasis> information sharing agreements are
          <emphasis role="italic">implied</emphasis> in the cross-organizational information sharing
        commitments that Channels dynamically generates. Potential sharing agreements are recomputed
        everytime the commitments (also computed) change because of modifications to the plan. A
        sharing agreement becomes permanent when it is confirmed. </para>
      <para>Channels discovers implied, to-be-confirmed sharing agreements by aggregating similar
        commitments that cross organizational lines into "information sharing relationships". Each
        information sharing relationship is a summary of sharing commitments for the same
        information (the agents in the commitments and their roles are abstracted out). For example,
        an information sharing relationship would summarize the fact that members of Bank A commit
        to share fraud information with members of Bank B. For each such relationship, a (potential)
        sharing agreement is produced and planners can indicate whether an information sharing
        agreement has been formalized, and attach or link to the MOU document formalizing the
        agreement.</para>

      <para>An organization may require that all its sharing commitments with other organizations be
        covered by sharing agreements. If a cross-organizational agreement falls under a
        non-confirmed agreement, an issue is raised by Channels. Furthermore, if a sharing agreement
        is confirmed but not documented, an issue is also raised. Note that in applying these
        constraints, Channels does not distinguish whether both organizations belong to a common
        parent organization or not.</para>

      <title>Descriptions, instructions and attachments</title>
      <para>Not everything in the definition of an IS plan can be captured neatly as "structured
        data". Some important data is best conveyed with free form text or via attached
        documents.</para>
      <para>Most forms used to define elements of an IS plan contain a text field called
        "description" where planners can optionally enter explanatory or documentary text. Instead
        of a description field, tasks and flows have instruction fields. Organizations also have
        mission statement fields. Descriptions, instructions and mission statements are not examined
        by Channels (Channels is indifferent to their content) but they can appear in reports,such
        as the IS guidelines, that Channels produces.</para>
      <figure>
        <title>A segment, like most elements of an IS plan, has a description</title>

      </figure>
      <para>Sometimes an element of a plan or the plan itself can be documented by a PDF or a Web
        page or illustrated by a photo or a video. Channels allows planners to attach documents to a
        plan element by uploading them or linking to them in the context of that element.</para>
      <para>An attachment is optionally given a name (its URL is the default name). It is also given
        a type. Different kinds of plan elements allow different kinds of attachment types. Certain
        types of attachments have different properties.</para>
      <para>The types of attachments recognized by Channels are:<itemizedlist>

              prohibit execution of the task or of the flow only in some but not all circumstances
              (and in ways too complex to be captured formally in the IS plan). To prohibit a flow
              or a task in an IS plan, planners must explicitly mark it as prohibited (via a check

      <title>Tagging</title>
      <para>Tags provide a useful mechanism for the ad hoc cataloging of elements of an IS plan that
        otherwise may have nothing else in common. Most elements of a plan can be tagged. An element
        can have multiple, comma-separated tags.</para>

      </figure>
      <para>The set of all tags in an IS plan is called the tag domain. Tags can be grouped by named
        sub-domains. When a tag belongs to a sub-domain, the tag is written as the name of the
        sub-domain followed by a colon followed by the name of the tag. For example,
        "esf:transportation" is the tag "transportation" in the tag sub-domain "esf". </para>
      <para>A planner can easily look up all elements tagged with tags belonging to a given
        sub-domain. Tag sub-domains can be predefined and attached to an IS plan (an attachment of
        type "Tag") prior to the tags being used. Note that tags need not be predefined to be used
        in tagging plan elements.<figure>

      <para>A special kind of tag sub-domain is called an "information standard". Each information
        standard tag is associated with a list of predefined elements of information, each with a
        name, and optional description and handling instructions. When a flow is tagged with an
        information standard tag, its elements of information can be auto-populated with those
        associated with the tag. An information standard tag sub-domain is added to an IS plan by
        attaching a file defining them (an attachment of type "Info standards").</para>

      <db:title>Information sharing requirements</db:title>
      <db:para>An IS plan is an IS practices model (task definitions linked by information flows)
        applied to an IS environment (actual organizations with their agents in roles of
        responsibility to be assigned to tasks). The resulting IS plan generates IS commitments
        between agents in the IS environment that are assigned to tasks connected by information
        sharing flows.</db:para>
      <db:para>IS requirements are how planners specify what kinds of IS commitments the IS plan is
        required to produce between participating organizations. </db:para>
      <db:para>An IS requirement can be defined broadly ("Each organization shall at least share
        something with each other organization.") or narrowly ("The FBI shall share threat reports
        with at least two agents in each of the transit security agencies when the threat level is
        high"). IS requirements can be added to the plan at any time during its
        construction.</db:para>
      <db:para>An IS requirement, depending on how it is defined, might apply to all pairings of
        (actual) organizations, where one organization is the source (or the committer) and the
        other is the receiver (the beneficiary of the commitment), or it might apply only to a few
        pairs, or to only one. </db:para>
      <db:para>A pair of organizations an IS requirement applies to can satisfy the requirement
        weakly, strongly or not at all, depending on the number and nature of the sharing
        commitments that "network" the two organizations. </db:para>
      <db:para>Just as with any other plan element, an IS requirement is given a name and, possibly,
        a description. Planners can attach documents to a requirement as well as add ad hoc issues
        about it.</db:para>

      <db:para>Except for the minimum and safe number attributes, all of the defining attributes of
        an IS requirement can be left empty in order to match any and all values. When all
        attributes in the definition of requirement are left empty or at their default value, the
        requirement can be interpreted as "Each organization shall share at least something with
        each other organization." This "empty" requirement applies to all possible
        source-beneficiary pairings of organizations in the IS plan.</db:para>
      <db:para>When analyzing an IS requirement, all possible source-receiver pairs of organizations
        are identified and only those to which the requirement apply are retained. Then, for each
        applicable pair, the IS commitments where the "committer" is an agent in the source

        The object of the analysis is to see if enough agents in the source organization commit to

      <db:para>Each organization in a source-receiver pair might not equally satisfy an applicable
        IS requirement. The source organization might satisfy the requirement strongly by having at
        least the safe amount of agents committing to share with agents in the receiving
        organization. The receiving organization might satisfy the requirement but only weakly
        because even though it meets the minimum count of beneficiary agents and the minimum count
        of alternate committing agents per beneficiary agent, it does not meet the safe count in
        both counts.</db:para>
      <db:para>The satisfaction of a requirements is considered impossible when there is no flow
        defined in the plan that could conceivably yield an IS commitment as specified by the
        requirement. For example, if the IS requirement is about sharing information tagged
        esf:hazard and not a single flow in the plan is tagged with esf:hazard, then the requirement
        satisfaction is rated as "impossible".</db:para>

    <title>Using Channels</title>
    <para>Channels is a collaborative Web application information sharing planners use to build,
      analyze and improve information sharing plans (IS plans), and to publish information sharing
      protocols (aka procedures or guidelines).</para>

    <para>A Channels server can host multiple IS plans. Users can be given access to more than one
      plan hosted on a Channels server.</para>

    <para>IS plans are versioned. Each plan has one development version being developed, possibly
      one production version that can no longer be changed, and zero or more retired versions (prior
      production versions).</para>

    <section>
      <title>User Roles</title>

      <para>Channels recognizes three user roles: administrator, planner, and participant.</para>

      <para>A Channels server has at least one administrator. An administrator has unlimited rights
        and privileges over the Channels server and the plans hosted on it. A user is given planner
        privileges by an administrator for some or all plans on a Channels server. Planners jointly
        develop, review, and deploy IS plans for which they have been given planner status by an
        administrator. </para>
      <para>Users can be given participant access to some or all plans by an administrator.
        Participants view their IS guidelines and respond to surveys from planners (currently only
        about issue resolution). A user can be a planner for some plans, a participant for others,
        and has no access to plans for which he/she is neither planner nor participant.</para>

      <para>An administrator implicitly also has planner privileges over all plans hosted on the
        Channels server. A planner for a given plan implicitly also has participant
        privileges.</para>

      <para>An administrator of a Channels server can:</para>

      <title>Logging In</title>

      <para>When accessing Channels, an unrecognized user is presented with a login screen. The user
        is asked to enter user name and password. To avoid being asked to login again after quitting
        without signing out, the user can check the "Remember me..." check box (the browser must
        allow cookies for this to work).</para>

      <para>Upon successful login, a user is taken to the Channels Home Page.</para>

      <para>Note that users can not self-register on a Channels server. They must be added together
        with their initial passwords by a Channels administrator.</para>

      <para>The home pages of administrators, planners, and participants have different content
        reflecting their differing privileges in regards to the selected plan.</para>
      <db:para>Keep in mind that an administrator is by default also a planner and that a planner is

      <title>Plan Editor Page</title>
      <section>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>The information sharing model page is also known as the Plan Editor. It opens on the
          version (development or production) of a plan selected in the Home page. A user can select
          plans for which he/she has planner privileges, unless the plan version is marked as a
          template in which case the user has access to the read-only production version, if
          any.</para>
        <para>Only the development version of a plan can be modified. A production version is
          “read-only.” In a read-only version, all form fields are disabled and no survey can be
          launched about issue resolution. Note that even though non-open participations in a plan
          can only be modified from the development version of a plan , they also apply to the
          production version.</para>
        <para>When the Plan Editor opens up on (a version of) a plan, Channels pre-selects a segment
          and a task within it. A segment and a task are always selected. The task with its
          “receive” and “send” information flows are shown “collapsed” and summarized.</para>
        <para>If the plan is brand new, an empty task in the otherwise empty and untitled segment is
          selected. An empty segment is about "responding" to an "unnamed" event . The last task in
          a segment cannot be removed. The last segment in a plan cannot be removed. Thus a plan
          will always have at the very least one segment, one event and one task.</para>
        <para>A planner can at any time switch segments, if more than one is defined. The tasks and
          information flows of the selected segment are visualized as a flow map (tasks connected by
          information sharing flows). The selected task is highlighted (by a gray outlined
          rectangle) in the flow map.</para>
        <para>The Plan Editor window has four principal components:<itemizedlist>

        <para>Tasks are the nodes (icons over text) in the graph. Information needs, capabilities,
          and information sharing flows (flows) are represented by the arrows. </para>
        <para>Tasks and flows are drawn in red if they have known issues (either detected by
          Channels or by planners). </para>
        <para>Green and red traffic lights represent the start and end of the event phase covered by
          the segment. Tasks that are triggered by the start of the segment are connected to the
          green traffic light icon. Tasks that cause an event are connected to a green traffic light
          representing the start of the event. Tasks that terminate the event phase are linked to
          the red traffic light.</para>
        <para>Information flows (information shared), information needs (information needed for
          carrying out, triggering, or terminating a task), and information capabilities (shareable
          information produced by the execution of a task) are all shown as arrows. Single-headed
          arrows represent notifications. Double-headed arrows are request-replies, with the empty
          arrowhead pointing to the task that consumes the information request, and the solid
          arrowhead pointing to the task that consumes the answer (the requested information flows
          to it). Receipt-confirmation receipt flows are show with a a half-arrow at one end
          representing the confirmation (see legend below). On-failure-only flows are represented
          with a black (or red if issue) square at the where the arrow connects to the failing
          task.</para>
        <db:para>Tasks are are deemed not to be realizable in the current environment are annotated
          with a small red "x" icon. A tasks may not be realizable, for example, because no agent
          can (yet) be assigned to it. Flows that can not be realized (no IS commitment found, for
          example) are displayed as dotted lines.</db:para>
        <para>Small squares connected to tasks are used in displaying information needs and
          capabilities. They stand for to-be-determined tasks. An arrow from a task to a dot
          represents an information capability of the task (information produced by the task that
          can be shared for use in other, to-be-determined tasks). An arrow from a small square to a
          task represents an information need of the task (the task needs information possibly
          produced by other, to-be-determined tasks).</para>
        <para>When risks and goals are shown in a flow map, they appear respectively as colored
          flags and stars connected to tasks (if they achieve a goal) and segment end icons (if
          goals are achieved by ending the segment's event phase).</para>

            it yields workable information sharing commitments (people can reach and understand one
            another.) Tasks that can not be realized as stamped with a small "x" icon. Flows that

        <title>Acquiring and releasing edit locks</title>
        <para>More than one planner can concurrently work on a plan. When two planners attempt to
          modify the same definition of a task, flow, entity etc., Channels allows only one planner
          to modify the form's field by giving the other planner read-only access to the form.
          Access is on a first-come-first-serve basis.</para>
        <para>When a planner opens an edit form on a plan element, Channels attempts to grab an edit
          lock on behalf of the planner for that plan element. If another planner already owns the
          lock, the form is shown to the first planner with the editable fields disabled.</para>
        <para>A lock on a plan element owned by a planner is released when the planner collapses or
          closes its edit form, or logs out. Note that the flow map is refreshed only when an edited
          form is closed.</para>
        <para>The name of the owner of a lock appears to other planners usually in the place of the
          "actions" menu for the locked plan element. A message can be sent to the owner of a lock
          by clicking on his/her name.</para>

        <para>A planner waiting for edit locks is notified with a message in the segment bar when
          any of the locks is released. The planner is then instructed to refresh the editor in
          order to acquire the released locks and enable editing. Mousing over the refresh notice
          shows the reason for it. Note that a refresh notice will also appear when another planner

        <title>Autocomplete form fields</title>
        <para>Naming matters a lot in Channels. Entities are referenced by their unique names and
          are created when first named. Using different names for what is essentially the same role,
          type of organization, etc. would become a source of confusion and would undermine the
          usefulness of an IS plan. Whether the names of tasks, flows, information needs,
          capabilities, and information elements are different or the same determines whether needs
          are satisfied or satisfiable.</para>
        <para>To help planners converge toward a coherent vocabulary, Channels often will suggest
          alternative names already in use via a drop down menu when a planner is entering a name.
          Channels uses semantic proximity matching to suggest to a planner not only names that look
          the same but names that have similar meanings. The planner may then elect to use a name
          already used instead of a new one with similar meaning.</para>

        <title>Tasks, receives and sends panels</title>
        <para>The task, receives and sends panels at the bottom of the plan editor show summaries of
          the selected task (there is always a task that is selected) together with a list of
          summaries of its "receives" (the task's information needs and the information flows to it)
          and a list of its "sends" (the task's information capabilities and the information flows
          from it). A task or send/receive summary can be expanded into a form for editing the
          definition.</para>
        <para>Clicking on the summary of a task, or selecting the "details" option in the task's
          "Show" menu, expands it by opening its edit form. To expand a "send" or "receive", a
          planner must first select it by clicking in its summary and then click the selected
          send/receive, or select "details" in the "Show" menu at the top of the list of
          sends/receives. Clicking on a send/receive in the flow map both selects it and expands it.
          Remember that when expanding a form, an edit lock is acquired if no one else has it. If
          someone else has it, the form is "read-only".</para>
        <para>The form for a task or for a send/receive comes in two formats: a simple format (the
          default) and the advanced format. A planner can switch between the two. The simple form
          format shows fewer fields and they tend to be the ones most often used. Typically, a
          planner will use mostly the simple forms to "sketch" tasks and sends/receives, and only
          later use the advanced forms to add more details.</para>
        <para>Channels automatically adapts the width of task and flow forms to provide ease of
          editing. Clicking on a summary closes the form.</para>
        <para>Note that, with very few exceptions, any and all fields in any form in Channels can be
          left blank. Of course, leaving <emphasis>all</emphasis> fields in a form blank is of
          little value. </para>
        <para>Each of the summaries is prefixed with a colored corner triangle. The color of the
          triangle indicates how important a task or a flow is. The color indicates the calculated
          impact of the task or the flow failing completely. Blue indicates a minor impact, yellow
          is major, orange is severe, and red is extreme. Gray triangles are used when failure
          impact does not apply (information needs and capabilities).</para>
        <db:para>If a send/receive can not be realized in the current environment, its summary is
          prefixed by a red "x" icon. A task that can not be realized is indicated by a "cog" icon
          with the red "x" in it.</db:para>

          <title>Editing a task</title>
          <para>A planner defines a task by naming it, categorizing it, tagging it. (Remember, just
            about every field in Channels is optional.) The planner further defines it by
            characterizing where it is to be executed, by whom, in what role within what
            jurisdiction, and on behalf of what organization. Any of the location, agent,
            jurisdiction, role, and organization entities that specify a task can be left unnamed so
            as to imply that more than one agent can be assigned to the task. The names of entities
            can be indicated to refer to actual entities (Morristown, NJ, John Doe, ACME, etc.) or
            to types of entities (a city, a certified technician, a corporation, etc.).</para>
          <db:para>The location where the task is to be executed is either named, communicated, the
            assigned agent's jurisdiction, or the organization's jurisdiction.</db:para>
          <para>The execution of a task can be set to be “as a team” to indicate that all assigned
            agents are to work together when carrying out the task. By default, assignees are each
            to execute the task independently.</para>
          <para>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to complete, whether it
            repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts automatically with the segment (implying
            that the assigned agents would become aware on their own of the onset of the segment's
            event phase).</para>
          <para>The purpose of a task can be stated as causing an event, terminating the event phase
            addressed by the segment, mitigating one or more risks, or achieving gains within the
            segment's scope.</para>
          <db:para>The task can be said to be "ongoing" (it's always being executed), or it to be
            initiated with the start of the event phase in which it is defined (no communication
            required).</db:para>
          <para>Reference and policy documents can be attached to the task either by URL or by
            uploading them. Finally, the task can be given a brief, informal set of
            instructions.</para>

          <title>Editing a "send" or "receive"</title>
          <para>The first step in defining either an information need, an information capability, or
            an information sharing flow is to name the information, identify its intent (command,
            alarm, announcement, report, or feedback), and define the elements of information, if
            any.</para>
          <para>The mode of communication is given as either notification or by-request (push or
            pull).</para>
          <para>Planners can specify if the information would be shared only in case to task failure
            ("sends" only).</para>
          <para>If an information flow (information that is shared) is a notification, then it can
            be made a broadcast (information will be shared with all agents assigned to the target
            task) or a unicast (information will be shared with at least one agent assigned to the
            target task).</para>
          <para>Keep in mind that an information flow that is a “send” to its source task is a
            ”receive” to its target task. One is looking at a single flow from either of its two
            ends.</para>
          <para>An information flow can be created by first adding an information need to a task (if
            necessary), then adding an information capability of the same name in another (also if
            necessary), and then connecting the need to the capability or vice-versa by setting the
            “from” or “to” field to the other task. Another way to create an information flow is to
            start from an information need or capability of a task and then name the task at the
            other end of the flow. If a task of that name does not exist, a new one is created and
            connected.</para>
          <para>When specifying or determining the source or target of a flow, a planner can
            restrict the sources and targets to be within the same umbrella organization, within the
            same (overall or specific) organization, or within the same location, or a supervisor,
            or self, or someone else. Adding a restriction on a sharing flow may filter out sharing
            commitments that would otherwise be implied by the flow (e.g., by dropping any sharing
            commitment that crosses organizational boundaries if sharing is restricted to within an
            organization).</para>
          <para>A communication delay is set either to zero (communication is to happen without
            delay) or to some finite time interval. For an information need, the delay represents
            the timeliness requirement for being notified (maximum delay from time of availability),
            or for getting a response to a request (maximum time elapsed from the request). For an
            information capability, the delay represents how quickly the information could be
            produced and communicated. For an information flow, the delay represents a “quality of
            service” commitment.</para>
          <para>The communication channels over which the information is to flow can be set for both
            an information need and for a notification information flow, but only when viewed from
            the notified task. The same is true for a requested information flow when viewed from
            the task that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are listed in
            order of preference.</para>
          <para>When editing a “send” or “receive,” a planner can set whether sharing would normally
            trigger or terminate a task. A notification could trigger or terminate the receiving
            task. It could also terminate the sending task, if sending the notification concludes
            the task that produced the information. A request could trigger the task that produces a
            reply.</para>
          <para>Planners can attach documents to a “send” or “receive.” A document can be a
            reference, a mandating policy, a prohibiting policy, an unspecified policy (contains
            language that may impose both obligations and restrictions), or it can be an image
            provided as an illustration (for example, a screenshot). Note that attaching a
            prohibiting policy to an information flow does not prohibit the generation of
            information sharing commitments.</para>
          <para>Instructions can be given as text in the definition of "sends" and viewed in the
            definitions of received information flows. Planners can express in "sends" whether a
            receipt confirmation is requested, whether the situation (event phase and context) is to
            be also communicated as part of a transmission, and , if applicable, whether an
            intermediate can be bypassed if unreachable.</para>

          <para>Information needed, shareable, or to-be shared can be decomposed into named
            elements. Each element of information sent or shareable can be described and assigned
            individual secrecy classifications as well as handling instructions. Planners can
            indicate whether and how a "sent" element of information is related to a received
            element of information (is the same one but renamed, is it an aggregation of many
            received elements?).</para>
          <para>An element sent is implicitly the same as one received if both are identically named
            and both comprise identically named incoming and outgoing information. If an element
            sent is in effect the same as one received but they have different names or comprise
            information with a different name, then planners need to indicate that the element sent
            renames the element received. If an element sent is a compilation/summation of multiple
            elements received, planners can identify the received elements that are aggregated into
            a sent element. Doing so enables Channels to track the planned dissemination of
            information.</para>
          <para>To reduce the drudgery of defining elements of information, the list can be

            in these IS commitments, and by setting the minimum, maximum and safe counts of
            committing agents per source organization, of beneficiary agents per receiving
            organization, and of committing agents per beneficiary agent.</db:para>
          <db:para>All fields in the definition of a requirement are optional, except for some

            names of elements of information. The information and element of information names match
            those uses in the definitions of flows (case and extra blanks are ignored). Element
            names can be added only if the information is named (they are meaningless

          <db:para>Since requirement specifies IS commitments one organization toward another, a
            requirement will characterize more or less broadly the agents in the source organization
            who will commit to share the information specified above. The requirement will also
            characterize the agents in the receiving organization who are the beneficiaries of the
            commitments. The committing and beneficiary agents are characterized the same way agents
            are characterized in a task definition, namely by agent name/type, role, jurisdiction
            (place name or type) and organization (name or type). AN empty characterization matches
            all agents in all organizations. </db:para>
          <db:para>Note that the values in the organization fields of both sources and receivers
            specifications are used during requirements analysis to determine the pairs of
            organizations to which the requirement can apply. If neither source organization and
            receiver organization are set, then the requirement will apply to all possible pairs of
            organizations. If for example, the plan has organizations A and B in scope, such a
            requirement will apply to source-receiving pairs A-B and B-A.</db:para>

          <title>Visualizing assignments and commitments</title>
          <para>The <emphasis>Assignments and commitments view</emphasis> is an essential tool for
            planners. It lets planners visualize and explore the assignments and commitments that
            are generated by a plan. If one thinks of an IS plan as an "IS commitment generator",
            then the assignments and commitments view is a means for planners to validate that the
            plan is working right.</para>
          <para>Remember that task assignments and information sharing commitments are implicit in a
            plan and are computed by Channels by matching known agents with task assignee
            specifications, and by applying the sharing restrictions set on flows that connect tasks
            to agents. In other words, assignments and commitments (IS procedures) are the result of
            applying an environment (known agents employed by known organizations) to an
            informations sharing model (specifications of tasks and flows).</para>
          <db:para>The assignments and commitments view produces a diagram of all task assignments
            linked by IS commitments, in essence a visual map of the IS procedures implicit in the
            plan. Planners should keep in mind that, even though the diagram looks very much like a
            flow map and correlates to them, it is not a flow map; the nodes are task assignments
            (not task definitions) and the arrows and IS commitments (not information
            flows).</db:para>

            choose a tree layout or a "web" layout as appropriate.</para>
          <db:para>The typology view is an essential tool for planners. How entities are categorized
            (in terms of entity types) determines, for example, which agents match the assignment
            characterizations set in a task's definition. A small change in, say, the typology of
            roles can drastically alter who is assigned to the plan's tasks and thus greatly impact
            the IS commitments produced from the plan.</db:para>
          <db:para>The typology view is the only way by which a planner can see at once the
            typologies that are otherwise implied by the categorization of a potentially large
            number of entities (the categorization of an entity is part of that entity's profile).
            Without this view, it would be very hard for a planner to catch "typology bugs" that

          <para>Inter-organizational sharing commitments are commitments between agents acting on
            behalf of different organizations. A sharing agreement may or may not exist for a
            sharing commitment that crosses organizational boundaries. It is an issue if an
            inter-organizational sharing commitment is unconfirmed when it is required by the
            committing organization. When viewing an organization, a planner can see the sharing
            commitments the organization makes with other organizations and confirm whether each
            commitment is covered or not by an agreement. A planner can attach documents of type MOU
            (Memorandum of Understanding) to confirmed sharing agreements. A sharing agreement not
            documented by a Memorandum of Understanding is an issue.</para>

          <para>When editing a transmission medium, a planner can set the transmission mode to

            the mode of this medium is already implied by that of another medium categorizing
            it.</para>
          <para>The address pattern is a “regular expression” that constrains the form an “address”
            can take for this medium (see <uri>http://www.regular- expressions.info/</uri> for a
            tutorial on regular expressions). An empty pattern imposes no constraint on the value of
            an address/endpoint.</para>
          <para>A planner can identify what media this a transmission medium can interface with
            (delegates to) as it carries out transmissions from sender to receiver. For example, a
            notification system would interface with phone, email, pager, etc.</para>
          <para>Finally, a planner can describe the security of the transmission medium in terms of
            secrecy classifications. Qualifying a medium as “US Gov/Top Secret” means that Top
            Secret information can be transmitted securely over this medium.</para>

        <title>Failure impact analysis panel</title>
        <para>Planners can visualize what might happen should an agent fail completely at an
          assigned task or should an agent break a commitment to share information. The consequences
          could be a number of downstream tasks failing, leading to gains unachieved or risks
          unmitigated.</para>
        <para>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always complete; a failed
          task does not produce any information that may be required by others, and a failed
          information flow does not transfer any information whatsoever.</para>
        <para>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly or indirectly depend
          critically on, or are triggered by, information that fails to be produced or to be
          shared.</para>
        <para>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not critical to a task or
          does not trigger it, then its failure does not propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if
          the target of a flow can get the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the
          failure of the flow may not matter. Finally, if information produced by an agent is
          necessarily consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure to share is
          meaningless.</para>
        <para>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful tasks. A useful task
          is one that achieves goals or one that produces information that triggers, terminates or
          is critical to another task that is itself useful. (Useless tasks are flagged as
          issues.)</para>
        <para>Note that a task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end and if the risk
          is said to terminate with the segment.</para>
        <para>A planner does “what-if” failure analysis by selecting a task or an information flow
          (“send” or “receive”) and then looking at the consequences should it fail. The planner can
          take a pessimistic outlook and assume that all redundant information flows would also
          fail, no matter what.</para>
        <para>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized as a directed graph of
          information flows, tasks, gains, and risks. Risks that would otherwise be mitigated or
          terminated by failed tasks are shown as color-coded flags. Red is for extreme risks,
          orange is for severe risks, yellow for major risks, and blue for minor risks. Risks that
          would normally be mitigated by successful tasks are shown connected to these tasks. Risks
          that would be terminated, should a segment end, are shown connected to red stop lights.
          Each stop light is itself connected to a failed task that would normally end the
          segment.</para>
        <para>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by importance, with red
          for very high, orange for high, yellow for medium, and blue for low.</para>
        <para>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed, goal-achieving tasks (the
          failures that matter) is compiled and presented. The table is paginated and the columns
          (failing task, segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization impacted)
          can be sorted.</para>

        <title>Information dissemination analysis panel</title>
        <para>If planners systematically indicate how elements of information flowing out of a task
          relate to elements of information flowing into a task, Channels becomes able to track the
          planned dissemination of individual elements of information. Dissemination tracking can be
          done forward (where does an element of information go?) and backward (where does an
          element of information come from?).</para>
        <para>A dissemination panel can be opened from a task, offering a choice of all elements
          received or sent by the task, or it can be opened from a flow, restricting the choice to
          the elements shared via the flow.</para>
        <para>Dissemination tracking from a task gives the option of looking at the sources as well
          as at the targets of individual elements of information. A dissemination panel opened on a
          "receive" flow only tracks sources, and a dissemination panel opened on a "send" flow only
          tracks targets.</para>

    <title>The ISP Method</title>
    <section>
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>Channels enables information sharing planners to apply the ISP Method, an incremental
        and nonlinear process for building information sharing plans from which useful analytics and
        robust information sharing procedures can be generated.</para>

      <title>ISP Method and ISP Process</title>

      <para>The ISP Method is encompassed by the ISP Process. The ISP Process includes the ISP
        Method and adds best practices for the successful promotion, definition, initiation,
        implementation, and review of information sharing planning projects. The ISP Process, other
        than its significance to the ISP Method, is outside the scope of this document.</para>

      <para>The ISP Method is defined in terms of the ISP concepts covered earlier and of ISP Method
        activities (activities for short). These activities should not be confused with ISP Process
        best practices. For example, a ISP best practice might help planners decide what the scope
        an IS plan should be, whereas a plan scoping activity would indicate any prerequisite
        activities, prescribe how to capture the scope of a plan (once decided upon), and indicate
        what further activities could follow up changes to the scope.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Overview of the ISP Method activities</title>

        <para>An IS plan is built by information sharing planners (planners) who carry out
          activities defined in the ISP Method in order to move the plan toward completion and also
          increase its value.</para>

        <para>Activities alter the scope of an IS plan, bring the plan closer to completion, or
          improve the quality and value of the IS procedures generated from the plan.</para>

        <para>Activities are organized into four groups:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Scoping</emphasis> an IS plan sets what an IS plan is about, but these
                activities can also be reapplied at any time, whenever the scope needs to
                change.</para>

                roles, phases and transmission media, or actual or types of organizations, places,
                and agents</para>

                complete, and reusable</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>There is no fixed, prescribed order to the execution of ISP Method activities. Scope
          can be modified at any time while an IS plan is being built. Tasks and information flows
          can also be added, removed, or modified at any point in time. Entities can be profiled as
          soon they are mentioned by name and they can be named at any time. An IS Plan can and
          should be improved early and often in order to keep it as manageable and as valuable as
          possible.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Issues</title>

        <para>The ISP Method defines a relatively large number (100+) of issues that can be detected
          in an IS plan. They are categorized as:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Validity issues</emphasis> - something is incorrectly specified or
              defined</para>

        </figure>

        <para>An issue can be about the IS plan as a whole, or about a segment, a task, a flow, an
          entity, or any other kind of plan element.</para>

        <para>An issue can be assigned a severity of minor, major, severe, or extreme. The severity
          of an issue is either preset according to the kind of issue (for example, an information
          flow without elements of information is always a major issue), or computed by determining
          the most severe risk mitigation or gain capture that could be foiled by a cascade of
          failures caused by the issue.</para>

        <para>An issue comes with one or more alternate options for its remediation. A planner can
          elect to launch a survey to gather opinions on how to remediate an issue.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Defining complete</title>

          <para>When is an IS plan complete? There is really no satisfactory answer to this
            question. Because one could always increase the scope of a plan, a more useful question
            would be: Given its current scope, is there something clearly missing from a plan? If
            the answer is no, then the plan can be deemed “complete.”</para>

          <para>Knowing whether the scope of an IS plan is properly set requires knowing the domains
            of human endeavor involved and being able to identify the organizations that ought to
            participate in the plan. Absent this knowledge, software can only examine an IS plan to
            detect what is inherently missing from it.</para>

          <title>Completion strategies</title>
          <para>The ISP Method proposes three distinct strategies for driving an IS plan toward

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Goal-driven</emphasis> strategy - Add goal-achieving tasks and work

            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis>Effect-driven</emphasis> strategy - Add tasks that execute at the
                onset of event phases and work forward by connecting tasks with outgoing
                flows.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>

                until none remains.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Planners usually use of all three strategies opportunistically when building an IS

          </figure>

          <para>Planners look at each organizational goal attached to a phase of an anticipated
            event, add tasks that achieve it, and add the information needs of each of these tasks.
            They then add tasks that produce the needed information and connect the tasks with
            information flows. This process continues until all goals are addressed by tasks, and
            all task information needs are satisfied.</para>

          <para>Systematic use of a goal-driven strategy guarantees that all tasks and flows, and

            because all tasks and flows contribute directly or indirectly to addressing identified
            goals. However, this strategy alone does not guarantee that tasks triggered by the start
            of event phases will be included. In other words, this "working from the end" strategy
            does not guarantee that it will reach all starting points.</para>

          <para>Planners start with the onset of an event phase, add tasks that are either directly

            these tasks to other tasks that are triggered or terminated by the shared information.
            Planners indicate whether tasks initiate or terminate events. This process continues
            until no task gets triggered or terminated by information produced by specified tasks,
            and all event phases are covered.</para>

          <para>Systematic use of an effect-driven strategy is akin to telling a story from

            and flows added using this strategy might not necessarily contribute directly or
            indirectly to achieving identified goals. In other words, a "starting from the
            beginning" strategy does not guarantee that it will reach all required end
            points.</para>

          <para>When using an issue-driven strategy, planners scan the list of outstanding issues
            and determine which ones to either waive or resolve. Issues of validity ought to be
            dealt with first, followed by issues of completeness and then issues of robustness.
            Usually, everything else being equal, issues of higher severity should be given higher
            priority for remediation.</para>

          <para>A planner selects a high-priority issue and either waives it (if applicable) or

          <para>A plan with no outstanding, “unwaived” issues means that Channels and the planners
            considers the plan to be valid, complete, and robust. Because Channels has no domain
            knowledge (for example, it knows nothing about public health or mergers and
            acquisitions, etc.), domain-dependent issues will not be detected by Channels. Planners
            must use their own domain knowledge to determine if the IS plan has issues that lie
            outside the range of automatically detected issues.</para>

      <title>About activities</title>

      <para>An ISP Method activity is carried out by an IS planner either to correct a mistake in
        the definition of an IS plan, bring the plan closer to completion, or make it more
        robust.</para>

      <para>An activity is composed of a number of steps, all of which may be optional, often to be
        carried out in no particular order. Most activities can be undone (for example, a task added
        to the IS plan can be later removed). Prerequisites for an activity, if there are any, are
        usually few and commonsense. For example, a task in a segment cannot be specified unless the
        segment is already defined.</para>

      <para>Note that for each "Add ..." activity there is usually an implied and related "Remove
        ..." and "Modify ..." activity. For example, "Add task" implies "Remove task" and "Modify
        task".</para>

      <para>Prior to applying any activity, it is assumed that:</para>

          <para>An IS plan has been created and given a unique identifier (the identifier is not the

        <title>Identifying an event as an incident</title>

        <para>The scope of an IS plan is largely set by identifying the types of anticipated events
          that are of concern. An event is considered an "incident" if it is unplanned (no task
          within the plan is expected to cause it). An IS plan always has at least one incident
          event within its scope. When an IS plan is created, an "unnamed" event is put in its list
          of incidents.</para>

        <para>When an IS plan is created, Channels automatically defines a "co-event" phase and
          calls it "Responding." If planners want to also plan for the "before" or "after" of
          events, they need to add them to the scope of the plan by naming them in the Details view
          of the plan definition panel. Planners can also rename the default "Responding" phase to
          anything they want. A phase that is not referenced anywhere, other than in the plan's
          Details view, can be removed from the scope.</para>

        <title>Identifying a participating agent</title>

        <para role="aspect">The scope of an IS plan includes not only participating organizations
          but also participating agents, that is, agents as role-playing members of organizations
          that can be assigned to tasks. Agents "employed by organizations" are added to the scope
          implicitly from the definitions of tasks, or explicitly by defining the "jobs" of
          participating organizations that are relevant to the plan.</para>

        <para>Since it is a best practice not to directly identify the assignees of tasks but rather
          to specify them via their roles in types of organizations, the preferred approach for
          identifying participating agents is to list them with their jobs in the profiles of
          participating organizations.</para>

        <para>An agent is further identified by associating one or more users to it. The meaning of
          associating a user to an actual agent depends on whether the agent is designated as an
          archetype, a placeholder, or (the default) a normal agent.</para>

        <para>An archetype agent captures the notion of a group of anonymous and indistinguishable
          agents (same contact info, same roles in the same organizations). An "ACME Call Center
          Agent" would be an archetype playing the role of "Call Center Agent" for the organization
          "ACME" and with some 1-800 number as its communication channel. Any number of Channels
          users can be associated with an archetype. These users all receive the IS guidelines of
          their associated archetype.</para>

        <para>A placeholder agent is an agent whose identity is to be given via their associations
          with users. A placeholder agent can be given default contact information that the
          associated user(s) can override and add to. A placeholder agent can be restricted to only
          one associated user or can be open to associations with many users. A user associated with
          a placeholder agent gets the IS guidelines of that agent, with the user's contact info
          substitutions/additions.</para>

        <para>The default kind of actual agent directly identifies the person or system and provides
          contact information as part of the profile. Only one user can be associated by planners
          with a normal, actual agent. The full name of the user and of the agent are expected to
          match (an issue is raised if not). The associated user gets the agent's IS guidelines. It
          is an ISP best practice to define agents, as much as possible, either as archetypes or as
          placeholders.</para>

        <title>Adding a secrecy classification system</title>

        <para>A secrecy classification system is a named ordered list of classification names (for
          example, US Government: sensitive, confidential, secret, top secret). Secrecy
          classifications are used to set agent clearances, communication channels' security, and
          the classification levels of elements of information. When an IS plan is created, it
          defines no secrecy classification system. Planners must first define a secrecy
          classification system before it can be applied.</para>

        <para>A secrecy classification level can be removed from a secrecy classification system if

        <para>The IS procedures of an agent (a person or system) are the list of all tasks assigned
          to the agent, plus all consequent information sharing commitments as computed from an IS
          plan in which the agent participates. Planners directly set IS procedures. IS procedures
          are specified by the definitions of tasks and flows and by the profiles of entities
          (roles, organizations, agents, places, etc.)</para>

        <para>The incoming flows of a task implicitly define satisfied needs for the task. By adding
          an explicit information need to a task, a planner defines an information requirement of
          the task that may or may not be satisfied by incoming flows. The planner also indicates
          that incoming flows partially satisfying or completing this information need are not
          necessarily the only acceptable sources. Channels looks at the information needs and
          information capabilities of tasks to uncover missed opportunities for information sharing
          (see "Satisfy all needs" in the Commands section).</para>

        <para>Note that only the explicit information needs of a task are visible across segments
          and offered as candidate targets for cross-segment flows. (Software types might want to
          think of information needs and information capabilities as defining the "interfaces of a
          segment.")</para>

        <title>Adding a task's information capability</title>

        <para>The outgoing flows of a task implicitly define information capabilities (ability and
          willingness to share) for the task. By adding an explicit information capability to a
          task, a planner defines information produced or acquired by the execution of the task that
          may or may not be shared to satisfy the information needs of other tasks. The planner also
          indicates that the targets of outgoing flows of the same name are not necessarily the only
          acceptable tasks the information can be shared with. Channels looks at information needs
          and information capabilities of tasks to uncover missed opportunities for information
          sharing (see "Satisfy all needs" in the Commands section).</para>

        <para>Note that only the explicit information capabilities of a task are visible across
          segments and offered as candidate sources for cross-segment flows.</para>

          or acquired for the execution of the source task, and the information is to be used for
          the execution of the target task. The same flow appears to the source task in its list of
          "sends" and to the target task in its list of "receives".</para>

      <title>Profiling entities</title>
      <section>
        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>In ISP, entities encompass the "static elements" in IS plans that can be unambiguously
          identified and thus uniquely named. ISP entities are events, phases (of events), agents
          (people or systems), organizations, roles, places, and communication media (phone, email,
          etc.) Tasks and flows are not entities because they are neither static (they are what
          agents do) nor are they uniquely named.</para>

        <para>Entities are referenced by name in the definitions of a plan, plan segments, tasks,
          flows, and in the definitions of other entities. An entity is created the first time it is
          named and is removed when no longer referenced (immediately if its definition is
          empty).</para>

        <para>Entities can be "actual" or "types". An "actual" entity represents a physical reality,
          whereas a "type of entity" represents a category of entity. "John Doe" would be an actual
          agent, whereas "Adult" would be a type of agent. "The United Nations" is an actual
          organization, whereas "International Governing Body" is a type of organization. And so on.
          Some kinds of entities can only be types in an IS plan, namely events, phases, roles, and
          communication media. ISP does not deal with actual events, only with types of anticipated
          events. Roles, phases, and communication media are inherently categories.</para>

        <para>Planners can define (profile) an entity as soon as it is first referenced by giving
          values to some or all of the entity's attributes. All entities, be they types or actual,
          have a few attributes in common:<itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Name - set when first referenced and changeable at any time</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Description - short, unstructured text</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Tags - a list of tags used for ad hoc grouping of plan elements</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Categories - a list of same-kind entity types (an agent is categorized by agent
                types, a role is categorized by other roles, etc.)</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Documentation (attached image, reference document, etc.)</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>

        <para>Of these common attributes, categories are particularly important. How an agent, role,
          place, organization, etc. is categorized can have wide-ranging consequences on how tasks,
          which are typically defined in terms of entity types, are assigned, and thus on what
          information sharing commitments are computed from an IS plan. A small change in the
          categorization of an organization or a role can significantly alter the IS procedures
          implied in an IS plan.</para>

        <para>Most kinds of entities have their own idiosyncratic attributes. For example, an actual
          organization can have a parent organization, an actual agent can have security clearances,
          a communication medium might delegate transmissions to other media, etc. The Profiling
          activities of the ISP Method describe what these attributes are and give their
          meanings.</para>

        <para>Entity profiles are accessed in different ways. An entity's profile can be accessed in Channels<itemizedlist>

        <title>Profiling a role</title>

        <para role="aspect">The assignees to tasks are typically specified in terms of their roles
          and the organizations or types of organizations they belong to. Roles should not be
          specific to organizations but cut across organizations. It would be counterproductive to
          have a Chief of Security at one organization and a Head of Security at another when both
          roles have identical responsibilities.</para>

        <para>How types are categorized by other types, that is, the typology of roles in an IS
          plan, is a key variable in the computation of task assignments, and thus information
          sharing commitments.</para>

          clearances, if any, are examined when the agent is the beneficiary of sharing commitments
          for classified information. An agent's contact information is shown in IS
          guidelines.</para>

        <title>Overview</title>
        <para>A number of ISP Method activities do not change the scope of an IS plan nor do they
          add elements to it, but rather are concerned with improving the plan overall. A plan is
          improved either by better distributing tasks and flows across segments, by generalizing a
          task's definition to increase the number of agents that are assignable to it, or by making
          changes to entity typologies that have wide-ranging effects on the generation of IS
          procedures.</para>

        <title>Moving tasks across segments</title>

        <para role="aspect">An IS plan is a collection of segments, each focusing on a specific
          situation, namely, one phase of one event, possibly in the context of other current or
          past events. Segments are usually inter-connected both by flows that connect two tasks in
          different segments, and by the fact that a task in one segment may trigger the situation
          that is the focus of another segment.</para>

        <para>Each segment addresses one or more risks to or opportunities for organizations (goals)
          for a given situation. As more goals are added to the scope, more tasks are needed to
          achieve them and to provide needed information. A segment could grow to become quite large
          and difficult to manage (the flow maps become oversized, the list of completeness issues
          for the segment become hard to track, etc.)</para>

        <para>A solution is to create a new segment, move to the new segment tasks from the large
          segment that achieve or help achieve a goal, and then remove the goal from the initial
          segment.</para>

        <para>Channels provides a simple and safe mechanism for moving selected tasks all at once to
          another segment while keeping them connected with their flows. Goals listed in moved tasks
          are added as needed to the destination segment. Moving tasks is a reversible (undo-able)
          change.</para>

        <title>Generalizing a task's definition</title>

        <para>Sometimes the assignees of a task are specified too narrowly in the definition of the
          task, possibly because an organization is identified by name in the definition, or because
          the role given is too specific. It can also be the case that an IS plan contains multiple
          tasks, each with the same name but with different, narrowly defined assignee
          specifications, that could be replaced by a single task with more broadly specified
          assignees.</para>

        <para>However, when two broadly defined tasks are connected by a flow, many of the implied
          information sharing commitments may be inappropriate. For example, assignees to both the
          source and target tasks of a flow may be from different organizations (organization types
          were used to specify task assignees). If the intent was for task assignees to communicate
          only with co-workers, then a planner must put in a restriction on the flow stating that
          sharing commitments are only between agents in the same organization. The alternative is
          to define multiple source and target tasks, each narrowly assigned to members of only one
          organization (but otherwise identically named pair-wise), and connect them with flows of
          the same name.</para>

        <para>It is an ISP best practice to avoid as much as possible having multiple tasks of the
          same name in the same segment, except for purposes of overriding tasks and/or flows (see
          section on Overriding tasks and flows). Generalizing task assignee specifications combined
          with flow restrictions can greatly reduce the number of tasks and flows in an IS plan,
          thus making it more manageable and easier to grow.</para>

        <title>Changing the categorization of an entity</title>

        <para>Entity types can themselves be categorized by other entity types. For example, a "Rail
          station" (a place entity type) can be categorized as a "Building" (another place entity
          type) and as a "Transit system node" (another place entity type). The categorization of
          entity types together creates typologies. Because tasks can be defined in terms of entity
          types (agent types, roles, place types, organization types), small changes to entity
          typologies can have wide-ranging effects on task assignments, and thus information sharing
          commitments.</para>

        <para>It is highly recommended that planners frequently look up typologies (agent typology,
          event typology, role typology, etc.) to make sure that each represents an intended
          conceptualization of the plan's environment and check the assignments calculated for tasks
          that are affected by the change.</para>

        <title>Commands</title>

        <para>Planners carry out ISP activities in Channels by executing Channels commands. Any
          change to an IS plan is the result of executing a command. Planners execute commands in
          Channels whenever they create and remove segments; when they add, cut, copy and paste
          tasks, needs, capabilities and flows; connect tasks with information flows, disconnect
          them, add an issue, remove a segment, move tasks across segments, add an intermediate to a
          flow, etc.</para>

        <para>Some commands are directly triggered from “actions” menus within the context of a
          plan, segment, task, flow, or entity. Other commands are triggered by updating fields in
          edit forms, or by pressing buttons.</para>

        <para>Some commands have simple effects (adding a task, for example) but others can be more
          complex:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>“Disintermediate” removes a task that acts as a middleman in a flow</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>“Intermediate” adds a middleman task to a flow</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>“Satisfy all needs” automatically connects information needs of a task to matching
              but untapped information capabilities from other tasks</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>"Move tasks" moves one or more tasks from one segment to another, possibly also
              adding goals achieved by the moved tasks to the target segment</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Complex commands are defined in terms of other commands that are executed completely
          or not at all. Most commands are reversible and can be undone and redone up and until some
          planner takes an action that would conflict with the undoing or redoing (for example,
          anyone removing a task prevents a planner from undoing a change he/she recently did to one
          of its attributes).</para>

        <para>The execution of each command is journaled for replay should the server be interrupted
          and restarted. It is also recorded and listed in the activities tab in the collaboration
          panel. Channels makes sure that only one command is being executed on an IS plan at a
          time, no matter how many planners are working on a plan.</para>
