/**
 * A descriptor for an element categorized by types. 
 * For each type given or implied, content is described. There can also be ad hoc content (not about a type).
 * Information content is a tree of named segments (e.g. profile), 
 * each containing elements of information (e.g. name, age) and/or segment (e.g. patient.profile).
 * An element of information (EOI) has name, says if its value is known (and if its predetermined), or if needs to be
 * known.
 * Privacy restrictions and confidence values can be assigned at the level of the information (as an aggregate of
 * information content) or at the segment level (for fine grained privacy and confidence valuation). Privacy restrictions
 * are ignored when information is used to express a need to know. Confidence is used to express quality requirements
 * (e.g. I only want this information with at least MEDIUM confidence in its accuracy).
