                    <description>As a template developer, you use Channels to design and build collaboration templates
                        that become the basis collaboration plans in which organizations and individuals participate
                        to get checklists that implement robust collaborations.

                        A collaboration templates forms the basis of collaboration plans where the identities of ''placeholder'
                        organizations are given and where users are assigned to the positions defined in the templates in terms of
                        jobs given to agents in organizations.

                        A collaboration template specifies how various kinds of organizations ought to communicate and share
                        information to collaboratively prevent, respond to, or recover from a number of anticipated
                        events that test their missions.

                        Channels continuously examines collaboration templates for gaps and brittleness, and suggests
                        options for remediation.

                        Channels produces visualizations, analytics and reports that help planners and stakeholders
                        understand and improve complex collaboration templates.

                        Channels is a ''planning'' tool. It does not manage the ''actual'' sharing of information. It is
                        used to capture and improve the collaboration ''practices'' of organizations and to adaptively
                        produce collaboration checklists.

                    <description>
                        Business processes (aka workflows) and collaborations are very different concepts. While some collaborations
                        can be captured as business processes, most collaborations can not. All business processes, however, can be captured as collaboration plans.
                        Furthermore, while business processes have "owners", no one by definition can be said to "own" a collaboration.

                        A ''business process'' is a close orchestration of people and systems within one (extended) organization,
                        all working harmoniously according to a known and repeatable script in order to accomplish organizational goals.

                        A ''collaboration'', as understood in Channels, is the coordination via communications of interdependent work done
                        by multiple individuals, from one or more organizations, where organizations are trying to achieve their own, possibly conflicting,
                        goals.

                        The goals of organizations, namely risk mitigation and opportunity captures, are
                        instantiated by events to be caused, prevented, responded to, recovered from etc. collaboratively.
                        These events, it is assumed, affect, in some ways or other, the participants in the collaboration,
                        driving them to collaborate and communicate.

                        Collaboration planning focuses on information as the source of task inter-dependencies.
                        Information dependencies are satisfied by communications that either coordinate (start, stop) tasks
                        or inform them so they can succeed (information sharing).

                        Unlike business processes, a collaboration plan does '''not''' tightly script the tasks; it only attempts to resolve their
                        information and coordination inter-dependencies via information flows and to make explicit the
                        expected task assignments and communication commitments that are required to successfully collaborate.

                        Whereas a business process will explicitly and formally script (program) tasks and communications, a collaboration plan
                        only ''implies'' the many possible sequences of tasks and communications that can resolve inter-dependencies
                        between organizations that are trying to achieve their missions in anticipated scenarios. This makes
                        a collaboration plan much less brittle than a business process when reality confounds expectations, as it often does.

                        Another important way in which collaboration planning differs from business process modeling is that collaboration planning assumes
                        that tasks and communications can and sometimes will fail.
                        This is why Channels encourages the design of redundant information flows in collaboration plans.

                        Most endeavors involving multiple organizations (each bringing its own agenda) can '''not''' be represented
                        realistically or usefully as business processes. However, most and possibly all multi-organization
                        endeavors can be represented as collaboration plans to be analyzed and improved upon.

                        It is easy to understand the allure of casting the work of organizations as crisp business processes.
                        If only we always knew exactly how to work together and if only we always did it predictably, infallibly and in complete harmony!
                        However, the reality is that only a small percentage of all the work we do with others fits the business process mold.

                        This is why most of the efficiencies to be gained from planning how we work together will
                        come from designing and improving collaboration plans, not from business processes.

                        Template developers can use various strategies when building a collaboration template.

                        They can use...

                        * a goal-driven strategy
                        * an effects-driven strategy
                        * an issues-driven strategy
                        * an opportunistic mix of all three

                        A '''goal-driven strategy''' focuses on achieving organizational goals in each scenario.

                        [[File:template_strategies_goal_driven.png|The goal-driven strategy]]

                        When applying this strategy, template developers...

                        * select an organizational goal in a segment
                        * add tasks to the segment that directly achieve the goal
                        * add tasks that produce information needed by other tasks in the segment
                        * and connect them with enabling flows

                        They repeat any or all of the above in all segments until...

                        * all relevant goals for all organizations in scope are listed
                        * all goals are achieved
                        * and all information needs are met

                        This strategy has pros and cons.

                        Pros: All tasks contribute directly or indirectly to achieving goals.
                        Cons: Event-triggered tasks might be ignored.

                    <description>
                        An '''effects-driven strategy''' focuses on the consequences of events and on the impacts of communicating.

                        [[File:template_strategies_effects_driven.png|The effects-driven strategy]]

                        When applying this strategy, template developers...

                        * select a segment covering a planning scenario
                        * and in that segment, they define tasks that are
                        ** directly triggered (no communications required) by the start of the segment's scenario
                        ** or are ongoing.

                        For each task, developers...

                        * indicate if it can cause an event or terminate the segment
                        * connect it to tasks it triggers or terminates via notifications or requests.

                        Developers repeat the above until nothing is caused, triggered or terminated.

                        This strategy has pros and cons.

                        Pros: Cause and effect relationships are more reliably captured.
                        Cons: Some tasks might not contribute to achieving goals.

                    <description>
                        An ''issues-drive''' focuses on strategy focuses on eliminating or waiving outstanding issues until none are outstanding.

                        [[File:template_strategies_issues_driven.png|The issues-driven strategy]]

                        When applying this strategy, template developers...

                        * select an issue, prioritizing...
                        ** validity issues
                        ** then completeness issues
                        ** and finally robustness issues
                        * waive an issue, if it is a ‚Äúfalse positive‚Äù and it can be waived
                        * or resolve the issue
                        ** possibly by applying one of the proposed fixes
                        ** and after surveying stakeholders as necessary

                        Developers repeat the above until no issues, detected by Channels or reported by developers, are left outstanding.

                        This strategy has pros and cons.

                        Pros: Channels will find issues that people would easily miss.
                        Cons: An issue-free collaboration template is not necessarily the right one.

                    <description>Collaboration Planning is the process by which organizations decide and agree on how they will coordinate and share information
                        in anticipated scenarios so that they can manage risks and capture opportunities.

                        Collaboration planning captures and disseminates as collaboration plans...

                        * the commitments of responsible individuals
                        * in anticipated planning scenarios
                        * to communicate and share information
                        * so that co-dependent organizations
                        * can successfully coordinate and inform
                        * tasks that achieve mission-critical goals
                        * in compliance with applicable policies.

                        The mission of collaboration planning is to help even strangers become successful collaborators at the very onset of crises
                        or the dawn of opportunities.

                        The collaboration planning process is iterative. [[File:collaboration_planning_process.png|The collaboration planning process]]

                        It consists of...

                        * Scoping future collaborations
                        * Building a collaboration template
                        * Creating and localizing a collaboration plan
                        * Managing participation in the collaboration plan
                        * Accessing collaboration checklists

                    <description>A collaboration plan defines how identified individuals in positions of responsibility within organizations
                        are expected to act and communicate in anticipated planning scenarios.

                        [[File:collaboration_plan_illustration.png|Collaboration plan]]

                        A collaboration plan is based on a production version of a collaboration template. [[File:collaboration_plan_based_on_template.png|Collaboration plans are based on collaboration templates]]

                        The template defines...

                        * the planning scenarios,
                        * the collaborators and their organizations,
                        * the tasks that directly or indirectly mitigate risks or achieve goals,
                        * the communications that coordinate and inform the tasks,
                        * and the checklists detailing when and how to execute the tasks and communicate.

                        The collaboration template is defined using "placeholders" for...

                        * organizations (organization placeholders),
                        * people and systems (agents)
                        * and places (location placeholders).

                        A collaboration plan adopting a template identifies...

                        * the locations of location placeholders,
                        * the organizations participating as organization placeholders,
                        * and users (and systems) participating as agents in positions of responsibility within participating organizations.

                        More than one collaboration plan can adopt a given collaboration template.

                        As placeholders from the collaboration template are identified in  collaboration plan by users and organizations,
                        checklists are personalized with contact information and are assigned to users based on their responsibilities.

                        Any authorized user of Channels can create a collaboration plan based on a published
                        collaboration template. This user automatically becomes a planner for this plan
                        and has ultimate authority over the registration of organizations into the plan, their participation
                        and the participation of users in positions of responsibility within these organizations.

                        A collaboration planner can define requirements on the plan that are to be fulfilled via adequate participation
                        by organizations and users. A planner can also view (but not modify) the collaboration template
                        upon which the plan is based and can see all issues detected in the plan.

                        Non-planners can elect to participate in a collaboration plan. Those who participate as agents that supervise
                        other agents have authority over the participation of users as these agents.

                    <description>A collaboration template captures how organizations would collaborate in anticipated scenarios.
                        It expresses collaboration rules and practices in terms of roles and it uses placeholders to
                        represent what might change during a collaboration or according to its context.

                        [[File:collaboration_template_illustration.png|A collaboration template captures generally applicable collaboration rules and practices]]

                        A collaboration template is defined in terms of...

                        * tasks required to achieve objectives in identified planning scenarios,
                        * the communications that coordinate and inform these tasks,
                        * how to assign tasks to individuals assigned on the basis of their positions in organizations
                        * checklists detailing how to execute each task and how to coordinate and inform their execution via communication and information sharing

                        A template identifies the organizations it involves either as ''known organizations'' - real-life
                        organizations - or as ''placeholder'' - organizations which real identities are to be given in
                        the collaboration plans that adopt the template.

                        A template also identifies the positions (aka organizational roles) that make up the collaborating
                        organizations. Users participate in the collaboration plans based on a template by being assigned to one or more positions defined in the template.

                        A collaboration template has versions. [[File:collaboration_template_versions.png|Collaboration template versions]] The most current version is the development version, accessible only to its developers and guests (who can only look but not touch). A development version can be put into production. Plans can only adopt the latest production version of a template.

                    <description>An organization is a group of individuals in positions of responsibility forming an administrative unit
                        that has a name and a mission.

                        An organization can be a corporation, a government agency, a department, a project team, a platoon etc.

                        An organization can contain sub-organizations.

                        The organizations known to a plan consist of...

                        * All the known organizations (as opposed to ''placeholder'' organizations) that are identified in the collaboration template adopted by the plan
                        * All (known) organizations registered in the plan only
                        * All (known) organizations registered in all plans hosted by the Channels service

                        An organization lists the positions that are relevant to the collaboration and to which it has given roles of responsibility.

                <item>
                    <description>A placeholder is an organization, place or individual whose final identity is not known
                        to a collaboration template but is known to collaboration plans based on it.

                        A placeholder for an individual is called a position in a collaboration plan.

                        A location placeholder that sets the overall locale for a collaboration plan must be instantiated
                        with an actual location for the plan to be opened for participation.

                        Most often, the term placeholder is used as a shorthand for organization placeholder.

                        The collaboration template upon which a collaboration plan is based identifies all the
                        organizations that are involved in the collaboration it defines. Because each collaboration plan
                        may involve its own, local organizations, template developers will often keep the identity of
                        organizations ''to be determined'' by making them ''placeholder'' organizations.

                        A placeholder organization from a collaboration template, for example "The Municipal Police Department",
                        can be associated to one or more organizations known to a collaboration plan, for example, "Gotham Police Department".

                        [[File:organizations_participate_as_placeholders.png|Organizations participate in a plan as placeholders defined in a template]]

                        A collaboration template may identify one of the positions in organizations it defines as
                        a ''custodian'' for a placeholder organization. If so, any user participating in a plan in this
                        position is authorized to associate an organization known to the plan with the template' placeholder
                        organization, in effect, involving the known organization in the collaboration defined for the placeholder
                        organization by the template.

                        Note that a planner acts as the default custodian for all placeholder organizations.

                <item>
                    <description>A position is a role assigned and title given to an individual by an organization.

                        A position in an organization can be filled by one individual and, sometimes, by or more functionally indistinguishable
                        individuals.

                        [[File:participation_in_position.png|A user can participate in a plan by filling a position]]

                        A position in an organization usually translates to task assignments and communication commitments
                        documented as checklists.

                        [[File:assignments_commitments_from_participation.png|Assignments and commitments from participation in a position]]

                        It is possible that by holding a (primary) position in an organization, a user will automatically
                        be assigned to ''linked'' positions in other organizations.

                        For example, a "Chief of Police" at some municipal police department (primary position) could,
                        according to a template, be automatically assigned to a position of "Member" of the county's
                        "Emergency Operations Center" (linked position). Thus a Chief of Police would have not only the jobs of a chief of police
                        but also all the jobs of a member of the county's emergency operations center.

                        [[File:linked_position.png|Linked position]]

                        Users participate in a collaboration plan by being assigned to one or more positions.

                        How many and which users can be assigned to a given position (and by who) depends on how
                        the position was defined by the developers of the template.

                        Some positions allow unrestricted self-assignment by users, others require confirmation by supervisors or planners,
                        yet others require some prior, confirmed employment. A position might allow only one user being assigned to it, another might allow any number.

                        The checklists collaboration checklists a user gets depends on the (accepted and confirmed) positions the user has.
                        The checklists are personalized with the contact names and information of other users participating
                        in positions this user will collaborate with according to the plan.

                        A user is the custodian of a placeholder organization if he or she is a planner or is assigned to

                        where the placeholder organization is defined.

                    <description>The participation in a collaboration plan is the sum of all organizations and users involved in it.

                        A known organization defined in the collaboration template upon which the collaboration plan is
                        based automatically participates (as itself) in the plan.

                        When an organization is registered in a plan, it does not yet participate in the collaboration
                        defined by the template on which the plan is based. Participation by an organization registered
                        in a plan happens when the organization is associated with a placeholder in the template.

                        [[File:organizations_participate_as_placeholders.png|Organizations can participate as placeholders defined in a template]]

                        When a registered organization is associated with a placeholder organization in the template,
                        the registered organization gets a ''copy'' of all the positions in the placeholder organization.

                        For example, when "Gotham Police Department" in the plan is associated with "Municipal Police department"
                        in the template, the position of "Chief at Gotham Police Department" is created as a copy of the
                        template-defined position of "Chief of Municipal Police Department".

                        [[File:positions_copied_from_placeholders.png|Organizations get positions from placeholders they fill]]

                        Users participate in a plan by assigning themselves or by being assigned to one or more positions
                        in participating organizations.

                        When assigned to a position in an organization by someone else, a user must accept the assignment
                        before it becomes active. Assignment to a position may require confirmation by all users participating
                        in supervisory positions.

                        when to execute the task and how to execute it, how to get needed information and
                        communicate information acquire while or from doing the task, what the relevant policies are and
                        what impacts a failing the task would have on the collaboration.

                        Each task in the collaboration template a collaboration plan is based on has an associated checklist,
                        minus contact information, that details how to execute the task.

                        When a user receives checklists from being assigned to positions assigned to tasks, the checklists
                        are personalized with contact names and information of other users who participate in positions the user collaborates with.

                        [[File:checklists_in_templates_and_plans.png|Checklists defined in templates are personalized in plans]]

                        A checklist is defined by the nature of the task, what triggers it and by the steps by which the task is best executed.

                        The triggers can be...

                        * nothing (if the task is ongoing),
                        * information self-acquired (observation of an event, for example),
                        * information to be researched to carry out another task also assigned to the user,
                        * information sent by another user (a notification)
                        * or information requested by another user (a query).

                        [[File:checklist_example.png|Sample checklist]]

                        The steps of a checklist can be communications (queries, notifications) or actions (other than communications) taken in executing the task.

                        A step can be required or optional. It might also depend on another having been completed and on some other conditions being present or absent, such as an information need being satisfied or the task having failed. A step can produce outcomes such as events or new information becoming shareable.

                        Keep in mind that the checklist is only a document; it is not an interactive to-do list (at least, not yet).

                    <description>A planning scenario describes anticipated circumstances that would introduce risks an opportunities to organizations who must then collaborate to mitigate those risks and/or seize those opportunities.

                        A planning scenario is defined as an event of significance (a change that matters somewhere in the world) that might happen, or is happening or has happened, possibly in the context of other event that are happening or have happened.

                        A collaboration plan might address more than one, presumably related, planning scenarios.

                    <description>A collaboration requirement specifies expected communication between two organizations in a plan.

                        The requirement specifies in more or less generic terms...

                        * the ''source'' and ''sink'' organizations,
                        * the information to be communicated
                        * the planning scenario in which this communication is to happen
                        * the number of positions in each organization sending and receiving the information
                        * the number of alternate source-positions for each sink-positions

                        A collaboration requirement may or may not apply to a pair of organizations in the plan.
                        If it does then, whether or not it can be realized according to the template-defined collaboration is examined and reported.

                        You can...

                        * create a new collaboration plan by first selecting the production version of a collaboration template on which the plan is to be based, and then pressing the "Start it" button - you will be the founding planner for this plan,

                    <description>The collaboration plan page is the home page of a collaboration plan.

                        As a user, you can decide to participate in positions (roughly, organizational roles) that are open to participation by all.

                        [[File:plan_user_managing_participation.png|User-managed participation]]

                        If you created the collaboration plan, you are the initial collaboration planner for this plan.
                        As such, you can authorize other users as planners and, if you wish and are not the only one, resign your planner privileges.

                        [[File:plan_planner_authorizing.png|Authorizing planners]]

                        A newly created collaboration plan is initially closed for participation. As a planner, you
                        decide when to open it (or later close it) for participation. The collaboration plan can not be opened
                        for participation [[File:plan_opening_participation.png|Opening a plan for participation]]
                        until the template's locale has been given an actual location, if it is a placeholder.

                        As a planner, you can name the plan, describe it and localize it.
                        You can also update it to a new version of the collaboration template if one is detected by Channels.

                        [[File:plan_setting_up.png|Setting up a collaboration plan]]

                        As a planner you can set collaboration requirements for the collaboration plan.
                        An issue is raised by Channels for each requirement that is not met.

                        [[File:plan_requirements_page.png|Plan requirements page]]

                        A plan is localized by resolving placeholder places from the template to known locations.
                        At a minimum, the placeholder locale of the adopted template, if identified, needs
                        to be resolved. Until it is, a planner can not open the plan for participation.

                        [[File:template_locale.png|Collaboration template locale]]

                        As a planner, you are automatically a guest of the adopted collaboration template. If you are a guest or
                        a developer of the collaboration template upon which the plan is based, you can access it.

                        As a planner, you can register organizations for potential participation into the plan (or in
                        all plans), in addition to the known organizations defined by the plan's template (they automatically participate).

                        [[File:plan_registering_orgs.png|Registering organizations in a plan]]

                        You can then assign known organizations (registered and from the template) to organization placeholders defined in the template.

                        [[File:plan_participation_organizations.png|Managing organization participation in a plan]]

                        You can also assign any and all users to positions that need to be filled.

                        [[File:plan_participation_users.png|User filling into positions a plan]]

                        As a planner, you can define requirements on the collaboration and visualize the extent
                        to which they are fulfilled given the current participation.

                        [[File:plan_requirements_page.png|Plan requirements]]

                        As a planner, you can view all issues detected in and reported about the collaboration plan.
                        You can waive issues that are "waivable".

                        [[File:plan_issues_managing.png|Managing a plan's issues]]

                        You can also see all issues, with metrics, in the plan issues report

                        [[File:plan_issues_report.png||Plan issues report]]

                        If, as a participant, you are assigned to a position where you supervise other positions, you can assign
                        users to these positions, subject to some constraints, and subject to they accepting the
                        assignment. You are also responsible for confirming these assignments in order to activate them.

                        [[File:plan_participation_confirmation.png|Confirming supervised participation]]

                        As a participant, you can access your collaboration checklists.

                        [[File:plan_checklists_accessing.png|Accessing the plan's checklists]]

                        You can also access the surveys you take part in.

                        [[File:surveys_page|The surveys page]]

                        And you can access the replies to feedback you have provided.

                    If you do, then you can assign yourself or be assigned to positions in organizations participating in the plan.

                    Assignments to positions will be subject to you accepting and, where appropriate, to being confirmed by supervisors.

                    Once you participate in a plan, you can withdraw from participation, but only if you are not a planner
                    and if you have not accepted any position. </description>

                        Defining a collaboration requirement means specifying how organizations in a collaboration plan are expected to communicate.

                        What the requirements want to enforce is '''not''' that participants will follow the directives
                        in their assigned collaboration checklists as defined in the collaboration template the collaboration plan is based on;
                        it is assumed (rightly or wrongly) that they will.

                        What requirements want to enforce is that, given ''current participation'' in the plan, and given
                        the checklists they currently have, certain organizations commit to communicate certain information
                        with certain others and that there will be sufficient redundancy in sources and targets.

                        A given requirement might apply to every possible pairing of known organizations in a collaboration plan or
                        only to some pairs of organizations. A pair of organizations to which a requirement applies consists
                        of a "source" organization (the one who commits to communicate some information) and of a
                        "receiver" organization (the other organization, who would be receiving the information as per the commitment).

                        To be precise, a requirement defines a subset of all the communication commitments that currently exist between users participating in a plan and asserts
                        that there will be, in that subset, enough sources, enough receivers and enough sources for each receiver.

                        One can think of the set of all communication commitments as the sum of all communication steps in all the checklists for all participants in a plan.

                        A requirement specifies (or not) ...

                        * the information to be communicated
                        * the positions in organizations who would commit to communicating it and their numbers (the sources)
                        * the positions in organizations who would benefit from these commitments and their numbers (the receivers)
                        * the expected number of sources per receiver (redundancy of source for each distinct receiver)

                        Documents can be attached to a requirement and planners can report issues
                        about the definition of a requirement.

                        [[File:plan_requirement_issues.png| Plan requirement issues]]

                        If information to be communicated is not specified then any information will satisfy the requirement.
                        If the sources are not specified then any user in any position in any organization can be a source satisfying the requirements.
                        The same logic applies to receivers.

                        Information in required communication commitments can be specified by giving none, any, or all of...

                        * its name
                        * tags applied to information flows in the collaboration template from which the communication commitments are derived (any information from a flow tagged by all the given tags will match)
                        * element names (any information with all the named elements will match)

                        [[File:plan_requirement_info.png|Plan requirement - Specifying information]]

                        If the information is not specified, then all communication commitments would match the information requirement.

                        The identities of sources are specified by naming none, any, or all of...

                        * the agent (hiring position of users) acting as the source
                        * the organization the agent works for
                        * the placeholder organization the above organization participates as

                        [[File:plan_requirement_source.png|Plan requirement - Specifying source]]

                        The commitments can be further specified in terms of how the sources would acquire the information to be communicated.
                        This is done by naming none, any or all of...

                        * the source task of the flow from which the commitment is derived
                        * tags applied on matching source tasks of flows from which commitments are derived
                        * the planning scenario in which the tasks are to be executed

                        If the sources are not specified, then all communication commitments would match the source requirement.

                        The requirement on sources also include the minimum, preferred minimum and an optional maximum number of different sources in all commitments
                        that match the requirement.

                        The receivers are specified similarly as to their identity. Similarly to sources,
                        the commitments can be further specified in terms of how the receivers would make use of the information to be communicated.
                        This is done by naming none, any or all of...

                        * the target task of the flow from which the commitment is derived
                        * tags applied to matching target tasks  of flows from which commitments are derived
                        * the planning scenario in which the tasks are to be executed

                        If the receivers are not specified then all communication commitments would match the receiver requirement.

                        The requirement on receivers also include the minimum, preferred minimum and an optional maximum number of receivers in
                        all commitments that match the requirement.

                        The required redundancy of distinct sources per receiver is defined in terms of a minimum, preferred,
                        and an optional maximum number.

                        Requirement analysis measures how well the requirements are satisfied by participation in the plan.

                        [[File:plan_requirement_analysis.png|Plan requirement analysis]]

                        Analysis consists in doing the following for each requirement ...

                        * Identifying all pairs of organizations (sources and receivers) to which the requirement applies
                        * For each pair, gather all communication commitments between each pair of organizations that match the requirement
                        * Count the number of commitments between individuals who are members of these organizations and count how many distinct individuals act as sources and receivers.
                        * Check if there are enough distinct sources and receivers, and if there are enough sources per receiver.
                        * Rate how the pair of organizations fulfill the requirement in terms of the counts being above the absolute minimum, below the maximum (if set) or right on target with the preferred minimum.

                        The rating for a pair of organizations is:

                        * '''Impossible''' if the template can not produce commitments that match the requirement
                        * '''Negative''' if the minimum number of sources or receivers is not met or the maximum is exceeded (it set)
                        * '''Weak''' if the absolute minimum and maximum numbers of sources and receivers is verified but not the preferred minimum
                        * '''Strong''' if the absolute minimum and maximum numbers of sources and receivers is verified as well as the preferred minimum

                        A diagram shows organizations linked by one or more requirements that apply to them. It also shows whether those requirements are satisfied.

                       The requirements between each pair are listed below the diagram together the satisfaction ratings. It is possible to view all the
                        communication commitments between a pair of organizations that go toward satisfying a given requirement.

                        * confirm the participation of users in positions you supervise,
                        * review, as planner, the participation issues detected by Channels,
                        * resign your status as collaboration planner (if you are not the only one) and bestow your planner privileges on another user.

                       You can browse all organizations known to the collaboration plan
                       (only organizations known to the collaboration plan can participate in it.)

                       All non-placeholder organizations from the collaboration template the plan is based on are always
                       known to the plan (and to all plans based on the template).

                       To enable other organizations to participate in a plan, planners must first register them locally
                       into the plan (or globally into all plans) and then, optionally, profile them. Only planners
                       can register new organizations and change the profiles of registered organizations.

                       [[File:plan_registering_orgs.png|Organizations registered and known to the plan]]

                       An organization is registered into a plan by giving its name and by indicating whether it is to be
                       known to the plan alone or to all plans hosted
                       on the Channels server. The scope of registration of an organization can be modified later as long
                       as it does not conflict with its participation (a global registration for an organization can not
                       be reversed to a local registration if the organization already participates in many plans).

                       After the organization is registered, planners are expected to profile it.

                       A registered organization is profiled by...

                       * Changing its name
                       * Providing a brief description (optional)
                       * Giving its street address (optional)
                       * Stating its mission (optional)
                       * Identifying its parent organization (optional)
                       * Providing contact information for the organization as a whole

                       [[File:plan_organization_profile.png|Editing the profile of an organization registered in the plan]]

                       The profile of a known organization defined in the collaboration template can not be modified by planners.

                        For members of an organization to participate in a collaboration and get their checklists, their
                        organization must first participate in the plan.

                        A non-placeholder organization from the collaboration template the plan is based on already
                        participate "as themselves" in the plan. Organization placeholders defined in the template
                        however await authorized participants in the plan to identify which organizations known to the
                        plan participate as these placeholders.

                        [[File:plan_participation_organizations.png|Managing organization participation]]

                        A participant is authorized to associate a known organization to a placeholder organization if
                        that user is a planner or participates in a position that makes him/her a custodian of that
                        placeholder organization according to the template. The template can set a limit on the number of
                        organizations that can participate as a placeholder.

                        Once an organization is associated with a placeholder, that organization inherits copies of all
                        the hiring and linked positions of the placeholder. If an organization participates as many
                        placeholders, it inherits positions from all of them.

                        [[File:positions_copied_from_placeholders.png|Organizations inherit positions from placeholders]]

                        Users who expressed intent to participate in
                        the collaboration plan can now be made given these hiring positions, subject to various constraints.

                        Users can volunteer to participate in hiring positions of participating organizations or be asked
                        to do so by authorized users.

                        Depending on how a hiring position in an organization has been defined by the developers of the
                        collaboration template, a user can volunteer his/her participation in that position or he/she must be
                        assigned to the position by supervisors or by planners. A supervisor for a hiring position (if
                        the position has one) is any user who is participating in a position that supervises the hiring position.

                        [[File:plan_participation_users.png|Managing user participation]]

                        A position might accept only one user or some number of users participating in it. This is set
                        by template developers in the template and can not be altered in a plan by planners.

                        A user can participate in any number of positions. A user must accept a participation for it to be
                        effective. If the position participated in is supervised, all supervisors must also confirm the participation.

                        When a user participates in a hiring position (accepted and confirmed if need be), the user automatically
                        participates in all positions linked to the hiring positions. The linking of positions is set by
                        developers in the collaboration template of the plan and can not be changed by planners.

                        [[File:linked_position.png|Linked positions]]

                        Participation in a position can be terminated...

                        * by the participating user un-accepting the position (the participation request remains and can be re-accepted)
                        * by a supervisor un-confirming the participation (confirmation becomes pending again)
                        * by a supervisor or planner deleting the participation (the participation request is removed)

                        When a position is defined as supervised (in the collaboration template the plan is based on),
                        participation by a user in that position only becomes effective when all users participating as
                        the supervisors of that position (immediately above in the chain of command) have confirmed
                        the participation.

                        As a participant, you are presented with all user participation that you either need to confirm or that
                        you have already confirmed. You then confirm participation or un-confirm participation you have confirmed.

                        As planner in a collaboration plan, you can authorize any other user to also become a planner.

                        You can resign as planner if you are not the last one. You can not "resign" someone else unless
                        you are a Channels administrator.

                        [[File:plan_planner_authorizing.png|Authorizing users as planners]]

                        Note that when a user creates a new collaboration plan (any user can do this), that user becomes the first
                        and founding planner.

                        Collaboration plan issues are detected automatically by Channels and refreshed every time a change is
                        made to the collaboration plan.

                        Issues can have to do with...

                        * Missing or improper participation
                        * Incorrect organization profiles
                        * Plan requirements not being satisfied
                        * Problem with the definition of a plan requirement (entered by planners)
                        * The current collaboration template being obsolete (a new production version is available)
                        * Missing user contact information
                        * Unresolved problem communicated via user feedback

                        Planners can waive an issue if it can be waived ("waivability" depends on the kind of issue).

                    <description>The ''All Checklists'' page let's you access
                        all your collaboration checklists and those of all participants you are allowed to see.

                        [[File:plan_checklists_accessing.png|All checklists page]]

                        If you are a planner, you can see the personalized checklists of all users and the generic checklists for all positions.

                        If you participate in a supervisory position, you can see the personalized checklists of all users participating in positions you supervise.

                        By clicking on a position, you access the checklists for those in that position. By clicking on a
                        participant's name, you access the combined checklists for all the positions assigned to the
                        participant in the plan.

                        Note that for a user who participates in only one position, this page is skipped and the user will be taken directly to the Participant Checklist page.

                    <description>The ''Participant's Checklists'' page displays the combined collaboration checklists...

                        * given to a user for participation in a position (personalized checklists)
                        * given to a user for all the positions the user participated in (personalized checklists)
                        * for a position based solely on the assigned tasks and required communications (generic checklists - no contact information)

                        [[File:participant_checklists_page.png|Participant's checklists page]]

                        A checklist describes...

                        * a task
                        * what events or communications trigger it (if any)
                        * the steps, with or without constraints, by which the task is executed, including
                        ** actions to be taken
                        ** queries, notifications and receipt confirmations to be made
                        ** self-assigned "research" sub-tasks
                        ** self-assigned "follow up" tasks


                        The prescribed process for executing the steps can be viewed as a diagram.

                        [[File:checklist_process_diagram.png|Checklist process diagram]]

                        Each checklist step can be expanded to see details about its execution, including contacts if it is a communication step.

                        [[File:checklist_step_expanded.png|Expanded checklist step]]

                        Each contact is linked to a user profile and contact information in the contacts directory.

                        A contacts directory, at the bottom of the page, details the contacts of all communications in the checklist
                        and gives access to the chains of command of each contact.

                        [[File:checklist_contacts_directory.png|Checklists contact directory]]

                        Users can provide feedback (question, suggestion or problem) about...

                        * the entire page
                        * individual checklists
                        * individual steps in checklists
                        * individual contacts

                    <description>A template element is anything with a name that contributes to the definition of a collaboration template.

                        A template element can be a segment, a task, a flow, a role, information etc. Template elements
                        are themselves defined in terms of other template elements.

                    <description>An event is an entity representing a transient change in the world that introduces
                        risks and/or opportunities for organizations.

                        Risks and events should not be confused. An event can introduce risks to one organization while
                        creating opportunities for another.

                        From the point of view of the template, an event is considered an ''incident'' if its occurrence
                        is not planned (it is an 'outside' event).

                    <description>A phase is an entity representing a time period relative to the occurrence of events. A
                        phase is either the time before, during or after events.

                        [[File:phase_illustration.png|An event phase is time relative to the occurrence of events]]

                        A collaboration template can address what happens before, during or after of events, or a
                        combination thereof. Each segment in a collaboration template focuses on one planning scenario
                        which is defined in terms of one phase of one event.

                    <description>The term ''planning scenario'' is used in collaboration planning to mean a phase of an
                        event being planned for, possibly occurring in the context of other past or current events.

                        A planning scenario is associated with risks and opportunities (gains to be achieved) for organizations.

                    <description>Goals are either risks to be mitigated or gains to be achieved by organizations.

                        In Channels, a goal is understood as a ''mission-level'' goal of one or more of the
                        organizations represented in a collaboration template. A goal, either a risk to be mitigated or an
                        opportunity to be seized, is the consequence of the onset or conclusion of an event.

                        Goals are achieved by successfully carrying out tasks, or they are automatically achieved when
                        an event terminates.

                        Mission-level goals are not to be confused with the implied and unstated goals of successfully
                        executing a task or sharing information.

                    <description>Collaboration templates are composed of one or more or more segments. Each segment
                        addresses a list of organizational goals to be achieved in one planning scenario.

                        No two segments should address identical goals in identical planning scenarios.

                        Two segments are connected by the flows that span them and by how a task in one segment can
                        start or end an events, thus initiating the other segment.

                    <description>Information is what is communicated by an agent (person or system) via a transmission
                        medium.

                        Information is named and can be described by a list of its essential elements.

                        Information can be constrained to compliance with a named information product that defines a
                        standard list of elements of information.

                        Each element of information has a name, can be accompanied by handling instructions and be given
                        a secrecy classification.

                    <description>A task is an action or decision taken, individually or as a team, by agents
                        (people or systems) assigned to it.

                        A task's outcomes can be...

                        * an event triggered or terminated,
                        * goals achieved
                        * information acquired that can then be shared

                        A task specifies what agents known to the collaboration templates will be assigned to it and,
                        whether they will be executing the task individually or as a team.

                        A task can also specify where the task is to be executed and how the location will become known to the agents
                        assigned to the task.

                        Each task is accompanied by a checklist that details how to execute the task.

                        that information with agents carrying out a task that ''consumes'' it.

                        An information flow is defined in terms of...

                        * The information being communicated
                        * The source task where the information was acquired
                        * The target task where the information is consumed
                        * The impact (triggering, terminating, informing) of communicating the information on either source and target tasks
                        * The transmission media over which the information would be communicated
                        * The maximum acceptable delay between acquiring the information and communicating it
                        * Instructions, such as whether to also share the planning scenario in context

                        An information flow can connect tasks that are from different segments.

                        the assignment profile of the task.

                        The assignment profile specifies agents by naming (or not)...

                        * The actual agent
                        * A type of agent
                        * A role in which the agents are employed
                        * The place or type of place matching the jurisdiction of the employed agents
                        * An actual or type of organization employing the agents

                        [[File:task_assignments_computing.png|How agents are assigned to a task]]

                        Leaving an attribute of an assignment profile empty indicates that any value is acceptable. For example,
                        leaving the jurisdiction unspecified means that assignment is not restricted by jurisdiction.

                        More often than not, a task's assignment profile will not name a specific agent but will only name a role
                        and a type of organization.

                    <description>A communication commitment is the promise by one agent to communicate information acquired
                        to do or while doing a task with another agent who needs this information to initiate,
                        terminate or successfully execute some other task.

                        The communication commitments are derived from flows connecting tasks.
                        There is a communication commitment from each agent assigned to the source task to each agent
                        assigned to the target task such that the pair of agents respects the restrictions, if any, set on the flow
                        (in same organization, in different locations etc.)

                    <description>An issue problem with the collaboration template that is either detected automatically by Channels or, upon
                        review, by template developers.

                        An issue is either one of
                        * validity (something is inherently wrong in the template)
                        * completeness (something is obviously missing from the template)
                        * robustness (something is making a plan based on the template likely to fail)

                    <description>An attachment is an uploaded or linked document, image etc. that describes a template element.

                        You can attach uploaded or linked resources to a collaboration template or collaboration plan as
                        a whole, or to any element of a collaboration template or plan.

                        Attachments can be documents, graphics, videos etc. They can be named and categorized, typically
                        as reference, picture or policy.

                    <description>An information product is an entity representing a standard bundle of elements of
                        information.

                        Information products are typically used to specify types of reports that are to be shared.

                        An information product be defined as an extension of another information product to which it
                        adds elements of information.

                        It is recommended that info needs, capabilities and flows be defined in terms of information
                        products.

                    <description>A role is an entity representing a standard set of responsibilities that various
                        organizations can assign to its members.

                        A role, such as Manager, is different from a job title, such as Senior VP Sales. Unlike job titles,
                        roles are not meant to be included in checklists or anything else shown to participants in collaboration
                        plans based on the collaboration template.

                        Roles are always entity types and they can form taxonomies whereby a role has a narrower meaning than another.
                        For example, a manager would be categorized as an employee, meaning that all managers are employees
                        but not all employees are managers. Manager being narrower than employee, we say that manager ''inherits'' from employee.

                        Roles are used by template developers to define the jobs of agents in organizations and to specify
                        task assignment profiles that will match agents based on their direct or inherited roles.

                        Based on the example above, a task assigned to all employees would also implicitly be assigned
                        to all managers since a manager is also an employee. Clearly, great care must be taken in defining
                        the taxonomy of roles in a collaboration template.

                    <description>An agent is an entity representing one or more interchangeable persons or systems.

                        An agent is a placeholder for participants in collaboration plans based on the collaboration template.

                        An agent can be employed by one or more organizations in titled positions, each specified by a
                        role.

                        Agent ''types'' are not to be confused with ''roles''. Agent types are used to categorize agents
                        independently of their roles. Agent types are typically used to represent qualifications.
                        Examples of agent types are "adult", "trained in CPR", "licensed diver" etc.

                    <description>A place is an entity used to represent an area in space, usually an administrative are.

                        A place is used to delimit jurisdictions of agents employed by organizations,
                        to locate where tasks are to be executed, where events are of significance, and where a collaboration template
                        is meant to apply (its locale, which is to be identified by each collaboration plan based on the template).

                        A place can represent either an actual place ("Grand Central Station") or a type (category) of places
                        ("Rail Station").

                        An actual place is either a known place ("New York City") or a placeholder for a known place
                        (The Flooded City). The identity of a placeholder place (or placeholder location) is to be
                        resolved by each plan adopting the template.

                        The use of placeholder places is required when...

                        * stating the scope of an event
                        * stating the default locale of the template as a whole

                        Place placeholders enables developers to co-reference a (to-be-determined) place in a template.
                        For example, a task could be defined as needing to be executed in the same location as the scope of the
                        event that triggered it. This would be done by using the same placeholder place as the scope of the
                        event and as the location of the task.

                        which agents communicate.

                        A transmission medium can be meant for broadcasting (to all), multicasting (to many but not all) or
                        narrowcasting (to one per communication).

                        A transmission medium is always a type (a category).

                        [[File:template_task_overriding.png|How a task overrides another]]

                        An agent is assigned to the overriding task (the more exclusive one), not the overridden task.

                        An information flow with the same name as another flow overrides it if its source task and target task
                        both override the source and target tasks of the other flows.

                        Agents with commitments from a flow can not have commitments from an another flow
                        that's overridden by the first flow.

                    <description>A checklist trigger is the condition that (could) initiate the execution of the task
                        detailed by the collaboration checklist.

                        The triggers of a collaboration checklist are the triggers of the task as derived from its definition.

                        A task and thus its collaboration checklist can be triggered by assigned agents...

                    <description>An entity is a grab bag term for plan elements that are "timeless things or concepts"
                        (as opposed to tasks and communicated information)

                        Entities are...

                        * agents
                        * events
                        * functions
                        * information formats
                        * information products
                        * organizations
                        * phases
                        * places
                        * roles
                        * transmission media

                        Channels distinguishes between "actual" entities and "types" (or categories) of entities. For
                        example, IBM is an organization whereas "Corporation" is a type of organization.

                        Entities are automatically created when they are first named in the definition of some template
                        element. No two entities of the same kind can have the same name in a template.

                        Entities can be categorized by entity types of the same kind (IBM - an actual organization - is
                        a Corporation -a type of organization - but it can not be a Manager - a role).

                        Categorized entity types form taxonomies (a Police Chief is a Manager is an Employee).

                        Events, information formats, information products, phases, roles and transmission media are
                        always types in Channels.

                        Questions be optional and can have single or multiple answers. They can also allow free commentary.

                        Template developers can define surveys for various kinds of template elements (surveys about
                        tasks, about events, about the collaboration template as a whole etc.).

                        A survey is applied to one or more template elements of the appropriate kind (a task survey can
                        be applied to many tasks) and is then sent to one or more users with an optional deadline.

                        Recipients of surveys can accept and answer the survey and revise their answers at any time.
                        Recipients can decline a survey or forward it to their contacts, who are then automatically
                        registered as Channels users.

                    <description>A tag is a word or phrase used to tag template elements in order to informally classify
                        them.

                        Tags can belong to tag domains. For example, ''esf:transportation'' is the tag
                        ''transportation'' in the tag domain ''esf''.

                        Tag domains can optionally be predefined by attaching specially formatted text ''tag'' text
                        files to the template.

                        A given tag can be applied without constraints to template elements of different kinds.

                        One use of tags is to specify information in collaboration requirements.

                        * a self-assigned research sub-task
                        * a self-assigned follow up sub-task

                        [[File:template_checklist_editor_steps.png|Steps in a checklist]]

                        A step may be required or optional. A step may have identify the completion of other steps as
                        pre-requisites.

                        A step, to be executable, may also require that some stated conditions (an event phase, a goal
                        having been achieved, an information need having been satisfied, the task having failed) be
                        present or absent.

                        The communication steps of a checklist are implied by the flows in and out of a task, to and
                        from other agents(requested info to be received and notifications to be sent).

                        [[File:template_checklist_communication_steps.png|Communication steps from flows]]

                        If a flow triggers the task the checklist is for and if the flow is marked as requesting confirmation
                        of receipt, then a confirm receipt communication step is automatically added to the checklist.

                        The sub-task steps are implied by flows to self - research sub-tasks are triggering requests to
                        self and followup sub-tasks are triggering notifications to self.

                        [[File:template_checklist_subtask_steps.png|Subtask steps from flows]]

                        The conditions on executing steps can be the goals achieved and events triggered by the task, or
                        other stated conditions.

                        The outcomes of a task (events caused or terminated, goals achieved, sharing capabilities
                        acquired) can be associated with the execution of individual steps.

                        Channels will raise an issue whenever a condition or outcome from the definition of a task is
                        not referenced by at least one step, for example, when a goal achieved by the task is not
                        associated with a step in its checklist.

                    <description>A function specifies the goals to be achieved, the information needed and the
                        information to be acquired by any task implementing the function.

                        Functions are "entities" and so they can be categorized by other functions. Functions are always
                        entity "types"; there is no such thing as an "actual" function.

                        [[File:function_and_tasks_illustration.png|Tasks can implement functions]]

                        A task may or may not declare that it implements a function. If it does, it is expected to
                        conform to the specifications of the function. Issues are raised if the task does not fully do
                        so.

                    <description>As a template developer, you can access collaboration template editor and a summary report
                        on all issues found in the template.

                        [[File:template_page.png|A collaboration template home page]]

                        As a developer or authorized user you can access the planning surveys you participate in and the
                        feedback you provided.

                        Documents that have been attached to the template are directly accessible. New ones can be
                        added.

                        You can switch to another template - or another version of this template - by mousing over the
                        name of the template in the "breadcrumbs" at the top of the page. A drop-down menu of templates
                        will appear. If this page was accessed from a collaboration plan, only the versions of the
                        plan-adopted collaboration template are accessible.

                    <description>As a template developer, you use the template editor to...

                        * define the scope of the template in terms of risk/opportunity-causing events and of the organizations involved,
                        * compose the template from segments, each one addressing one phase (before, during, after) of one event, and some of the attendant risks/opportunities
                        * define for each segment the information sharing and tasks required to deal with these risks and opportunities
                        * profile the entities (events, phases, organizations, roles etc.) referenced in the collaboration template
                        * report issues in addition to those automatically detected by Channels
                        * view analytics to better understand the consequences, strengths and weaknesses of the template

                        The collaboration template editor is composed of the panes...

                        * Presence/activity/messages pane
                        * Flow map pane

                <item>
                    <description>The scope of the collaboration template is determined in part by the planning scenarios
                        it addresses. A planning scenario is defined in terms of the phase (before, during or after) of
                        an event and by the event itself. For examples, planning scenarios could be responding during an
                        earthquake (the event), or recovering after an earthquake.

                        [[File:template_scoping_events_phases.png|Naming all events and event phases in scope]]

                        The list of all events and phases within the scope of a template thus determines what planning
                        scenarios are within the scope of the collaboration template.

                        The ''All events and phases'' panel allows you to see all events and phases referenced the
                        template and to directly add new ones, as well as delete any not yet referenced.

                        The ''Events'' tab gives access to the list of all events in scope. A new event event can be
                        added by naming it. Since the event is not referenced anywhere else (yet) in the template, it is
                        considered an ''incident'', that is, an external event not caused by a planned task. Its
                        ''incident'' status can only be changed once there is a task that causes it. Events referenced
                        in the plan, other than in this panel,can not be removed from the list.

                        The ''Phases'' tab gives access to the list of all event phases in scope. A new phase can be
                        added by naming it. A phase not yet referenced anywhere else in the template can be deleted.

                        Note that Channels will expect to see at least one segment for each combination of phase and event in scope.

                    <description>All segments in the template are grouped either by event or by phase. They are
                        connected by cross-segment flows and by causation links.

                        [[File:template_all_segments.png|All segments in a template, grouped and connected]]

                        A cross-segment flow is a flow from a task in one segment to a task in another. A causation link
                        is an event caused or terminated by a task in one segment that sets the conditions for another
                        segment.

                        You can drill down on the cross-segment flows and on the causation links.

                        what effects.

                        Represented in a flow map are...

                        * Events which initiations or terminations trigger tasks
                        * Event initiated or terminated by tasks
                        * Goals (risks or opportunities) achieved by tasks
                        * Tasks
                        * The information needs and capabilities of tasks
                        * Information sharing flows connecting tasks

                        Using view controls in the left-hand side, you can...

                        * hide or show info needs and capabilities,
                        * hide or show goals,
                        * hide tasks without assignments and flows without commitments
                        * maximize the flow map to occupy to whole browser window,
                        * shrink it to fit in the display space,
                        * squeeze the flow map to make more space for the task and flow forms,
                        * simplify it by reducing the amount of information displayed,
                        * replace the task and flow forms by a table showing issues related to the selected flow or task
                        * show a legend about the flow map

                        A task is brought into focus for editing by clicking on it in the flow map. Flows can also be
                        opened for editing by clicking on them in the flow map.

                        To access a task's form, select the task in the flow map and then click on its summary to reveal
                        the task's definition form. You can toggle between a simple form (only basic fields are shown)
                        and advanced form (all fields are shown).

                        Tags set on a task can be used, among other things, to categorize the assignments that are derived from it. These tags
                        can be used in defining collaboration requirements in a collaboration plan.

                        A flow is defined by first adding an information need and then identifying a source task, or by

                        [[File:template_flow_source_target.png|Identifying a source or target task]]

                        What is to be communicated in a send or receive is a combination of...

                        * the information that justifies the communication
                        * if allowed, the context in which the communication is made, namely, the current planning scenario

                        Tags set on a flow can be used, among other things, to categorize the commitments that are derived from it. These tags
                        can be used in defining collaboration requirements in a collaboration plan.

                        An information need or capability can be marked as ''private'', in which case it is not to be communicated
                        to participants in a collaboration plan. This will come into play when Channels supports the execution
                        of plans.

                        The properties of an element of information are...

                        that ''consumes'' it. It is equivalent to connecting an info capability of a task with the info

                        [[File:template_flow_source_target.png|Identifying a source or target task]]

                        A sharing flow is created by connecting an info need or a capability to a task. The flow appears
                        in the ''Receives'' of the consuming task and in the ''Sends'' of the producing task.

                        Tasks in different segments can only be connected via their respective, defined information need and
                        information capability. You might want to thin of information needs and capabilities as defining
                        the "flow connecting interface" of segments.

                        [[File:flows_across_segments.png|Connecting tasks with flows across segments]]

                        Channels can be asked to automatically create flows by connecting all tasks with matching
                        information capabilities and needs, within and across segments. This is done by using the
                        menu item ''Satisfy all needs'' in a task's actions menu.

                    <description>You can see the list of all tasks that either override this task or are overridden by it.

                        [[File:template_task_overrides.png|List of overridden tasks]]

                        A task is said to override another if the task names are the same (case is unimportant) and if the
                        agent assignment profile of the first task narrows the assignment profile of the other task.

                        [[File:template_task_overriding.png|How a task overrides another]]

                        In other words, any agent assigned to the overriding task would also be assigned to the overridden
                        task but not vice-versa. For example, a task "Detect threats" assigned to all Managers overrides
                        a task "Detect threats" assigned to all Employees because a Manager is an Employee but an Employee
                        is not necessarily a Manager.

                        If an agent is assigned to a task that overrides another task, it is '''not''' assigned to the
                        overridden task. in the above example, an agent who is a Manager would be assigned to only one task,
                        the one profiled for Managers, not the task profiled for Employees, even though the agent matches it
                        too.

                    <description>A checklist comes pre-populated with steps representing the requested information to be
                        received, the notifications to be sent, the research and follow-up sub-tasks that are defined
                        for the task as flows.

                        [[File:template_checklist_editor.png|Checklist editor]]

                        These communication steps can not be removed from the checklist. Action steps, representing
                        simple activities requiring no communication or new information, can be added and removed.

                        A step can be given...

                        * Prerequisite steps - steps the step must come "after"
                        * Conditions that must be present for the step to be taken ("if")
                        * Conditions that must be absent for the step to be taken ("unless")
                        * Outcomes from the execution of a step

                        Action steps (not communication steps) can be marked as "required", else they are optional.
                        Communication and sub-task steps are marked as required if they are notifications or follow-ups.

                        Conditions applicable on steps are either...

                        * Goals achieved by the task
                        * Events triggered or terminated by the task
                        * Information needs of the task
                        * The task having failed (a non-optional condition for "on-failure notification steps)
                        * Conditions ''local'' to the execution of the task added to the checklist - they can also be removed

                        Outcomes of a steps can be...

                        * Goals, if any, achieved by the task
                        * Events, if any, caused or terminated by the task
                        * Sharing capabilities acquired for or from successfully executing the task

                        [[File:template_checklist_step_editor.png|Editing a step in a checklist]]

                        A checklist must be confirmed to be deployed to participants as such. Any change to the implied
                        communication steps or to the action steps requires a re-confirmation.

                        A process flow describing the execution of the checklist is accessed by clicking on the flow
                        icon next to the name of the task. The process flow shows all steps, their pre-conditions and outcomes
                        as icons set between a start and stop icons. The process diagram shows when steps can be executed in no
                        particular order or in a sequence.

                    <description>The checklist flow diagram depicts how the steps in the checklist are to be executed.

                        [[File:template_checklist_process_diagram.png|Checklist process diagram]]

                        The green dot represents start of execution and the red dot its end. Execution is from left to
                        right.

                        Steps that can be executed in parallel are depicted in parallel. Steps that must precede one
                        another are depicted in sequences.

                        Steps that are executed conditionally are preceded by ''if'' and/or ''unless'' conditions. If
                        there is more than one condition constraining a step, the conditions precede the step in a
                        sequence.

                        The outcomes of steps are shown linked to the steps.

                        One or more known organizations in a collaboration plan can participate as the planned placeholder
                        organization. The participating organization inherits (a copy of) the agents employed by the
                        placeholder.

                        The custodian of a placeholder organization is the agent authorized to register known
                        organizations as participating as the placeholder. Whoever in a plan participates as this agent is an acting
                        custodian. Collaboration planners are by default acting custodians.

                        collaboration template the plan has adopted.

                        Depending on the participation constrains set for the agent...

                        * any number of users can participate as the agent
                        * or exactly one user can participate
                        * or at most a specified number of users can participate

                        Furthermore, who can participate as the agent can be set to...

                        * any user whatsoever (open participation)
                        * or users confirmed in their participation by other users participating as the agent's supervisors
                        * or users already participating as agents employed by one of the agent's organizations

                        Participation can be anonymous, in which case the names and contact information of participating
                        users will not appear in the checklists of other users.

                    <description>Define a function that tasks can implement.

                        A function can be...

                        * named
                        * described
                        * categorized by other (more generic) functions

                        A function defines the kinds of goals, if any, a task implementing it is expected to achieve, as
                        well as the information needs and information capabilities that such a task is expected to have
                        in order to conform to the function.

                        The goals specified by a function are goal categories plus whether they are risks to be
                        mitigated or gaines to be made.

                        The information needs and capabilities specified by the function are named, optionally point to
                        an information product, and define function-specific elements of information.

                        When a function is categorized by other functions, it adds to the goals, information needs and
                        information capabilities that the categorizing functions define.

                        Some issues detected by Channels can be waived (marked as false positives).

                        The developer-reported issues can be opened up
                        to edit their names, description, severity and remediation options. When editing remediation
                        options, start each one on a new line.

                    <description>Collaboration checklists are computed by assigning agents to tasks and by deriving
                        communication commitments from the flows connecting assigned tasks.

                        A key concern is making sure that the right agents get assigned to the right tasks, and that
                        only the right agents that are assigned to the tasks on each side of a flow become parties to
                        communication commitments.

                        Which agents are assigned to a task is determined by...

                        * how a task specifies the agents assignable to it
                        * what agents are in the template's environments and how they are profiled
                        * how the agents are employed (role, jurisdiction, organization)
                        * how the taxonomies of role, agent, organization etc. are defined

                        * what restrictions are put on pairing agents into commitments (the committer and beneficiary must be in the same organization etc.)

                    <description>Entities (i.e. roles, agents, organizations, places, events etc.) can be categorized.
                        Agents are categorized by agent types, organization by organization types, events by other
                        events (events are always types) etc.

                        [[File:template_improving_taxonomies.png|Validating domain entity taxonomies]]

                        How entities are categorized largely determine the meaning of the tasks, flows, employments etc.
                        that are defined in terms of these entities.

                        The meaning of a template boils down to the task assignments and consequent communication commitments
                        (checklists) that are implied by the collaboration template.

                        Even a small change to the taxonomy (a.k.a. typology) or roles, for example, can cause
                        widespread changes to the checklists computed from a template, and thus its meaning.

                        Taxonomies are defined implicitly by categorizing individual entities. The best way to verify
                        that taxonomies are correct is to visualize them.

                    <description>A ''flow map'' shows tasks connected by flows where each flow can imply a potentially
                        large number of communication commitments. The ''checklists map'' makes it easy to see if the sharing
                        commitments generated from the template are the intended ones.

                        [[File:template_improving_checklists_map.png|Using the checklists map]]

                        The map is focused on one agent or one organization (as an aggregate of agents). It shows the
                        commitments that involved that agent or organizations.

                        The other parties to the commitments can be aggregated by role, organization type or not at all.

                        Clicking on an assigned task navigates to the task's definition and opens the checklist flow

                        task names, segment names and their confirmation status.

                        Checklists can be filtered to see only the ones confirmed or not confirmed, or to see only the

                    <description>You can enlist the help of stakeholders via surveys. A survey is a questionnaire about
                        elements of the template or the template as a whole.

                        [[File:template_learning_questionnaire.png|Composing a survey questionnaire]]

                        You compose questionnaires by adding, ordering, editing etc. statements and questions. Questions
                        can be marked as required or optional.

                        A questionnaire applies to the template as a whole or to one kind of template element (template
                        questionnaire, task questionnaires, event questionnaires etc.)

                        Questionnaires can be activated and deactivated. They can be extended while they are being used
                        in surveys.

                    <description>A survey is launched on the template or on a template element by applying a
                        questionnaire to it, usually from within its definition.

                        A survey about fixing an issue can be launched from where the issue is reported. The questionnaire
                        is automatically built to offer a choice of remediation options.

                        automatically generated based on the remediation options.

                        The questionnaire can be modified and extended while the survey is ongoing.

                        An issue remediation survey is automatically deactivated when the issue disappears.

                        Note that the issue remediation questionnaires are by default not shown in the list of all
                        questionnaires; a checkbox must be checked to see them.

                    <description>Once a survey is launched, users can be invited to participate in it. Users can be
                        given a deadline to answer all of the required questions in a survey.

                        [[File:template_learning_survey_participation.png|Managing participation in a survey]]

                        After the deadline has passed, the survey is considered late. Late participants can be
                        ''nagged'' (nags are sent by email).

                        A participant can...

                        *accept the invitation by answering questions,
                        *decline the invitation
                        *forward the survey to others (if it was marked as forwardable).

                        Note that anyone who is forwarded a survey and who is not yet a user of Channels is
                        automatically given a login, password and limited access to the template as a participant.

                <item>
                    <description>Whenever a template element is referenced by name in the definition of another, there
                        will also be a link to get to the referenced element's definition.

                        Also, most forms used to define an element of the template contain a table listing and linking
                        to all other elements that reference it in their definitions.

                        For example, at the bottom of in the profile of a role is an index of all other template
                        elements that reference the role or that match the role.

                    <description>As an administrator, you manage templates and users for a Channels server.

                        Template management consists of...

                        * Creating a new template with a unique resource identifier (URI)
                        * Deleting a template - permitted only if not yet adopted by a collaboration plan
                        * Putting the current development version of a template into production
                        * Naming the owner of the template
                        * Changing the default email addresses at which user or developer feedback is sent

                        User management consists of...

                        * Adding a new user with a unique username - be aware that users can not be deleted, only disabled
                        * Giving a user a full name, email address and password - the user can later modify all of these
                        * Making the user as an admin
                        * Disabling the user - this can be later reversed
                        * Giving the user developer vs guest (view-only) status for specific collaboration templates.
