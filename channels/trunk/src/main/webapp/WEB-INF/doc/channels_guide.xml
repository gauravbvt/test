                    <description>As a participant in a community, you may be asked by domain planners to answer surveys in order to help improve the collaboration plan.
                        
You can 
                        
* see the surveys you need to complete (and optionally complete them or forward them),
* see those you completed (and revise you answers),
* and see those you declined (and perhaps change your mind).</description>

You can then examine to what extent each requirement can be satisfied by the applicable pairs of organizations, should they follow the plan.
                    
You can add a new requirement definition by pressing the New button in the Definitions tab.
                    
To edit a requirement definition, press on the Edit button next to it in the list of requirements.</description>

The checklists describe

* expected tasks
* what events or communications trigger them (if any)
* the steps, with or without constraints, by which tasks are executed, including
** actions to be taken
** queries to be made
** self-assigned "research" sub-tasks
** self-assigned follow up tasks

                    <description>As a planner, you use Channels to design collaboration plans from which robust collaboration checklists are generated.
                    
A collaboration plan models how various types of organizations share or ought to share information to collaboratively prevent, respond to, or recover from a number of anticipated events that test their missions.
                    
Channels continuously examines these ''collaboration plans'' for gaps and brittleness, and suggests options for remediation.
                    
Channels produces visualizations, analytics and reports that help planners and stakeholders understand and improve complex collaboration plans.               
                
Channels is a ''planning'' tool.  It does not manage the ''actual'' sharing of information. It is used to capture and improve the collaboration ''practices'' of organizations and to adaptively produce collaboration checklists.

                    <description>Channels computes personalized collaboration checklists from a collaboration plan and provides them to plan participants on demand.
                    
As a user's participation in a plan changes, even as events unfold, Channels automatically adapts and updates the user's checklists.

                    <description>A collaboration plan is the combination of
* a model of how information is to be acquired and shared so that tasks that achieve organizational goals can be successfully carried out
* a plan scope that identifies the plan's participants, namely, people and systems in roles of responsibility within organizations

Applying a scope to a collaboration model produces visualizations, analytics, diagnostics, reports and, crucially, collaboration checklists.

A collaboration plan has one editable development version, zero or one production version (read-only) and any number of retired versions (also read-only). 

The development version is released by an administrator. Upon releasing a new version of the plan, a copy of the development version becomes the new production version and the prior production version is retired. Finally, the development version number is incrementd by one.</description>

                    <description>An event is an entity representing a transient change in the world that introduces risks and/or opportunities for organizations. 

Risks and events should not be confused. An event can introduce risks to one organization while creating opportunities for another. 

From the point of view of the plan, an event is considered an ''incident'' if its occurrence is not planned (an 'outside' event).</description>

A collaboration plan can elect to address what happens before, during or after of events, or a combination thereof.

                    <description>The term ''scenario'' is used in collaboration planning to mean a phase of an event being planned for, possibly occuring in the context of other past or current events.

                <item>
                    <description>In Channels, a goal is understood as a ''mission-level'' goal of one or more of the organizations involved in the plan. A goal is either a risk to be mitigated or an opportunity to be seized due to the onset or conclusion of an event.
                    
Goals are achieved by successfully carrying out tasks, or they are automatically achieved when an event terminates.

Mission-level goals are not to be confused with the implied and unstated goals of successfully executing a task or sharing information.

                    <description>Collaboration plans are composed of one or more or more segments. Each segment addresses a list of organizational goals in one scenario.

No two segments should address identical goals in identical scenarios.

Two segments are connected by the flows that span them and by how a task in one segment can start or end an events, thus initiating the other segment.

Information is named and can be described by a list of its essential elements.

Information can be constrained to compliance with a named information product that defines a standard list of elements of information.

Each element of information has a name, can be accompanied by handling instructions and be given a secrecy classification.

                    <description>An entity is a grab bag term for "timeless things and concepts". Entities include
* agents
* events
* information formats
* information products
* organizations
* phases
* places
* roles
* transmission media

Channels distinguishes between "actual" entities and "types" (or categories) of entities. For example, IBM is an organization whereas "Corporation" is a type of organization.

Entities are automatically created when they are first named in the definition of some plan element. No two entities of the same kind can have the same name in a plan.

Entities can be categorized by entity types of the same kind (IBM - an actual organization - is a Corporation -a type of organization - but it can not be a Manager - a role). 

Categorized entity types form taxonomies (a Police Chief is a Manager is an Employee).

Events, information formats, information products, phases, roles and transmission media are always types in Channels.</description>

* terminate the task
* be critical (crucial) to the task's success
* be useful

When doing failure impact analysis, only flows that trigger, terminate or are crucial to the task's success are considered.

                    <description>Planners can define surveys for various kinds of plan elements (surveys about tasks, about events, about the plan as a whole etc.).
                    
A survey is a questionnaire composed of required and optional questions. Questions can have single or multiple answers and they may allow free commentary.
                    
A survey is applied to one or more plan elements of the appropriate kind (a task survey can be applied to many tasks) and is then sent to one or more users with an optional deadline.
                    
Recipients of surveys can accept and answer the survey and revise their answers at any time. Recipients can decline a survey or forward it to their contacts, who are then automatically registered as Channels users.</description>

Tags can belong to tag domains. For example, ''esf:transportation'' is the tag ''transportation'' in the tag domain ''esf''.
                    
Tag domains can optionally be predefined by attaching specially formatted text ''tag'' text files to the plan.
                    
A given tag can be applied without constraints to plan elements of different kinds. 
                    
One use of tags is to specify information in collaboration requirements.</description>

                    <description>A collaboration checklist lists the steps required to successfully execute a task. 
                        
A step can be either

* some stated activity (other than communicating)
* an information request to make,
* a notification to send,
* sending confirmation of information received,
* a self-assigned research sub-task
* a self-assigned follow up sub-task

A step may be required or optional. A step may have identify the completion of other steps as pre-requisites.

A step, to be executable, may also require that some stated conditions (an event phase, a goal having been achieved, an information need having been satisfied, the task having failed) be present or absent.

Channels will raise an issue whenever a condition or outcome from the definition of a task is not referenced by at least one step, for example, when a goal achieved by the task is not associated with a step in its checklist.

The communication steps of a checklist are implied by the flows in and out of a task, to and from other agents(requested info to be received and notifications to be sent). 

The sub-task steps are implied by flows to self - research sub-tasks are triggering requests to self and followup sub-tasks are triggering notifications to self.

The conditions on executing steps can be the goals achieved and events triggered by the task, or other stated conditions.

The outcomes of a task (events caused or terminated, goals achieved, sharing capabilities acquired) can be associated with the execution of individual steps.

Functions are "entities" and so they can be categorized by other functions. Functions are always entity "types"; there is no such thing as an "actual" function.

A task may or may not declare that it implements a function. If it does, it is expected to conform to the specifications of the function. Issues are raised if the task does not fully do so.

As a planner or authorized user you can access the planning surveys you participate in and the feedback you provided.
                    
Documents that have been attached to the plan are directly accessible. New ones can be added.
                    
You can switch to another plan - or another version of this plan - by mousing over the name of the plan in the "breadcrumbs" at the top of the page. A drop-down menu of plans will appear. If this page was accessed from a community, only the versions of the community-adopted plan are accessible.</description>

                    <description>As a collaboration planner, you use the plan editor to
                    
* define the scope of the plan in terms of risk/opportunity-causing events and of the organizations involved,
* compose the plan from segments, each one addressing one phase (before, during, after) of one event, and some of the attendant risks/opportunities
* define for each segment the information sharing and tasks required to deal with these risks and opportunities
* profile the "entities" (events, phases, organizations, roles etc.) referenced in the collaboration plan
* report issues in addition to those automatically detected by Channels
* view analytics to better understand the consequences, strengths and weaknesses of the plan

                    <description>All segments in the plan are grouped either by event or by phase. They are connected by cross-segment flows and by causation links.
                    
A cross-segment flow is a flow from a task in one segment to a task in another. A causation link is an event caused or terminated by a task in one segment that sets the conditions for another segment.
   
You can drill down on the cross-segment flows and on the causation links.</description>

                    <description>Information flow maps depict how information is consumed and produced by tasks and to what effects.
                    
Represented in a flow map are
* Events which initiations or terminations trigger tasks
* Event initiated or terminated by tasks
* Goals (risks or opportunities) achieved by tasks
* Tasks
* The information needs and capabilities of tasks
* Information sharing flows connecting tasks

Flow maps can be maximized, reduced-to-fit, and simplified by hiding goals, and info needs and capabilities.
                    
A task is brought into focus for editing by clicking on it in the flow map. Flows can also be opened for editing by clicking on them in the flow map.</description>

                    <description>An information sharing flow connect a tasks that ''produces'' information with a tasks that ''consumes'' it. It is equivalent to connecting an info capability of a task with the info need of another.

A sharing flow is created by connecting an info need or a capability to a task. The flow appears in the ''Receives'' of the consuming task and in the ''Sends'' of the producing task.

Tasks in different segments can only be connected via their respective, defined info need and info capability.

                    <description>A checklist comes pre-populated with steps representing the requested information to be received, the notifications to be sent, the research and follow-up sub-tasks that are defined for the task as flows. 
                        
These communication steps can not be removed from the checklist. Action steps, representing simple activities requiring no communication or new information, can be added and removed.

A step can be given:
* Prerequisite steps  - steps the step must come "after"
* Conditions that must be present for the step to be taken ("if")
* Conditions that must be absent for the step to be taken ("unless")
* Outcomes from the execution of a step

Action steps (not communication steps) can be marked as "required", else they are optional. Communication and sub-task steps are marked as required if they are notifications or follow-ups.

Conditions applicable on steps are either:
* Goals achieved by the task
* Events triggered or terminated by the task
* Information needs of the task
* The task having failed (a non-optional condition for "on-failure notification steps)
* Conditions ''local'' to the execution of the task added to the checklist - they can also be removed

Outcomes of a steps can be:
* Goals, if any, achieved by the task
* Events, if any,  caused or terminated by the task
* Sharing capabilities acquired for or from successfully executing the task

A checklist must be confirmed to be deployed to participants as such. Any change to the implied communication steps or to the action steps requires a re-confirmation.
                    
A process flow describing the execution of the checklist is accessed by clicking on the flow icon next to the name of the task.</description>

                    <description>The checklist flow diagram depicts how the steps in the checklist are to be executed.

The green dot represents start of execution and the red dot its end. Execution is from left to right. 

Steps that can be executed in parallel are depicted in parallel. Steps that must precede one another are depicted in sequences.

Steps that are executed conditionally are preceded by ''if'' and/or ''unless'' conditions. If there is more than one condition constraining a step, the conditions precede the step in a sequence.

The outcomes of steps are shown linked to the steps.</description>

                    <description>Define a function that tasks can implement.
                    
A function can be:
* named
* described
* categorized by other (more generic) functions

A function defines the kinds of goals, if any, a task implementing it is expected to achieve, as well as the information needs and information capabilities that such a task is expected to have in order to conform to the function.

The goals specified by a function are goal categories plus whether they are risks to be mitigated or gaines to be made.

The information needs and capabilities specified by the function are named, optionally point to an information product, and define function-specific elements of information.

When a function is categorized by other functions, it adds to the goals, information needs and capabilitites that the categorizing functions define.

Commitment networks depict these info sharing commitment relationships between agents either directly or aggregated by role or organization.

You can drill down on each commitment relationship to see the info sharing commitments it summarizes.

                    <description>Channels automatically detected issues about this plan element. You or other planners may also have reported issues about it.

All issues about the plan element are listed. The planner-reported issues can be opened up to edit their names, description, severity and remediation options. When editing remediation options, start each one on a new line. 

Some issues detected by Channels can be waived (marked as false positives).

You can report a new issue by pressing the New button and then editing the issue. When describing remediation options, start each one on a new line.

You can automatically create a survey about remediating an issue by pressing on the ''Create survey'' button. If a survey was already created, you can view it by pressing the the ''View survey'' button.

                    <description>Collaboration checklists are computed by assigning agents to tasks and by deriving information sharing commitments from the flows connecting assigned tasks.
                    
A key concern is making sure that the right agents get assigned to the right tasks, and that only the right agents that are assigned to the tasks on each side of a flow become parties to sharing commitments.
                
Which agents are assigned to a task is determined by
* how a task specifies the agents assignable to it
* what agents are in the plan's environments and how they are profiled
* how the agents are employed (role, jurisdiction, organization)
* how the taxonomies of role, agent, organization etc. are defined

                    <description> Entities (i.e. roles, agents, organizations, places, events etc.) can be categorized. Agents are categorized by agent types, organization by organization types, events by other events (events are always types) etc.

How entities are categorized largely determine the meaning of the tasks, flows, employments etc. that are defined in terms of these entities.

The meaning of a plan boils down to the task assignments and consequent sharing commitments (checklists) that are implied by the collaboration plan. 

Even a small change to the taxonomy (a.k.a. typology) or roles, for example, can cause widespread changes to the checklists computed from a plan, and thus its meaning.
                
Taxonomies are defined implictly by categorizing individual entities. The best way to verify that taxonomies are correct is to visualize them.

                    <description>A ''flow map'' shows tasks connected by flows where each flow can imply a potentially large number of sharing commitments. The ''checklists map'' makes it easy to see if the sharing commitments generated from the plan are the intended ones.
                
The map is focused on one agent or one organization (as an aggregate of agents). It shows the commitments that involved that egent or organizations.

The other parties to the commitments can be aggregated by role, organization type or not at all.

Clicking on an assigned task navigates to the task's definition and opens the checklist flow diagram for this task.</description>

                    <description>You can enlist the help of stakeholders via surveys. A survey is a questionnaire about elements of the plan or the plan as a whole.

You compose questionnaires by adding, ordering, editing etc. statements and questions. Questions can be marked as required or optional.

A questionnaire applies to the plan as a whole or to one kind of plan element (plan questionnaire, task questionnaires, event questionnaires etc.)

Questionnaires can be activated and deactivated. They can be extended while they are being used in surveys.

*accept the invitation by answering questions, 
*decline the invitation
*forward the survey to others (if it was marked as forwardable by planners).

Note that anyone who is forwarded a survey and who is not yet a user of Channels is automatically given a login, password and limited access to the plan as a participant.

Changes to a taxonomy can have profound impacts on the collaboration checklists that are generated by the plan. 
                   
Taxonomies can be visualized to verify that they are correct.</description>

Also, most forms used to define an element of the plan contain a table listing and linking to all other elements that reference it in their definitions.

For example, at the bottom of in the profile of a role is an index of all other plan elements that reference the role or that match the role.</description>

                    <description>As an administrator, you manage plans and users for a Channels server.

Plan management consists of:

* Creating a new plan with a unique resource identifier (URI)
* Deleting a plan - permitted only if not yet adopted by a community
* Putting the current development version of a plan into production
* Naming the owner of the plan
* Changing the default email addresses at which participant or planner feedback is sent

User management consists of:

* Adding a new user with a unique username - be aware that users can not be deleted, only disabled
* Giving a user a full name, email address and password - the user can later modify all of these
* Making the user as an admin
* Disabling the user - this can be later reversed
* Giving the user planner vs guest (view-only) status for specific plans.

Make sure to press the Apply button for changes to take effect.
