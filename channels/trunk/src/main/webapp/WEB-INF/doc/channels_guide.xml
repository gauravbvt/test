                    <description>As a model developer, you use Channels to design and build collaboration models
                        that become the basis collaboration communities in which organizations and individuals participate
                        to get checklists that implement robust collaborations.

                        A collaboration model defines rules and practices of successful collaboration that are to be applied by
                        communities of organizations in anticipated scenarios. More specifically, a collaboration model
                        specifies how various kinds of organizations ought to communicate and share
                        information to collaboratively prevent, respond to, or recover from a number of anticipated
                        events that test their missions.

                        Since models can not know ahead of time the identities of all organizations and individuals,
                        you can represent them as  "placeholders" to be resolved by collaboration communities that adopt your model.

                        Collaboration communities are expected to associate organizations to model-defined organization placeholders and
                        to assign individuals to the positions of responsibility within these organizations. These
                        individuals then receive access to the checklists you, as model developer, defined and that detail
                        how they are expected to collaborate and with who.

                        Channels assists you in the development of collaboration models by continuously examining them
                        for gaps and brittleness, and by suggesting options for remediation.

                        Channels produces visualizations, analytics and reports that help model developers
                        understand and improve complex collaboration models.

                        Always keep in mind that Channels is a ''planning'' tool. It does not manage the ''actual'' sharing
                        of information. It is used to capture and improve the collaboration ''practices'' of organizations and to adaptively
                        deliver collaboration checklists.

                    <description>
                        Business processes (aka workflows) and collaborations are very different concepts. While some collaborations
                        can be captured as business processes, most collaborations can not. All business processes, however, can be captured as collaboration plans.
                        Furthermore, while business processes have "owners", no one by definition can be said to "own" a collaboration.

                        A ''business process'' is a close orchestration of people and systems within one (extended) organization,
                        all working harmoniously according to a known and repeatable script in order to accomplish organizational goals.

                        A ''collaboration plan'', as understood in Channels, is the mutually expected task coordination,
                        information sharing and resource (asset) allocation to be carried out by responsible individuals within co-dependent organizations
                        that are trying to achieve their own, possibly conflicting, goals in given scenarios.

                        The goals of organizations, namely risk mitigation and opportunity captures, are
                        instantiated by events to be caused, prevented, responded to, recovered from etc. collaboratively.
                        These events, it is assumed, affect, in some ways or other, the participants in the collaboration,
                        driving them to collaborate and communicate.

                        Collaboration planning focuses on information as the source of task inter-dependencies.
                        Information dependencies are satisfied by communications that either coordinate (start, stop) tasks
                        or inform them so they can succeed (information sharing). Collaboration planning also addresses
                        the production, requesting and delivery of ''material assets'' required for the execution of tasks
                        and communications.

                        Unlike business processes, a collaboration community does '''not''' tightly script the tasks; it only attempts to resolve their
                        information and coordination inter-dependencies via information flows and to make explicit the
                        expected task assignments and communication commitments that are required to successfully collaborate.

                        Whereas a business process will explicitly and formally script (program) tasks and communications, a collaboration community
                        only ''implies'' the many possible sequences of tasks and communications that can resolve inter-dependencies
                        between organizations that are trying to achieve their missions in anticipated scenarios. This makes
                        a collaboration plan much less brittle than a business process when reality confounds expectations, as it often does.

                        Another important way in which collaboration planning differs from business process modeling is that collaboration planning assumes
                        that tasks and communications can and sometimes will fail.
                        This is why Channels encourages the design of redundant information flows in collaboration plans.

                        Most endeavors involving multiple organizations (each bringing its own agenda) can '''not''' be represented
                        realistically or usefully as business processes. However, most and possibly all multi-organization
                        endeavors can be represented as collaboration plans to be analyzed and improved upon.

                        It is easy to understand the allure of casting the work of organizations as crisp business processes.
                        If only we always knew exactly how to work together and if only we always did it predictably, infallibly and in complete harmony!
                        However, the reality is that only a small percentage of all the work we do with others fits the business process mold.

                        This is why most of the efficiencies to be gained from planning how we work together will
                        come from designing and improving collaboration plans, not from business processes.

                        Model developers can use various strategies when building a collaboration model.

                        They can use...

                        * a goal-driven strategy
                        * an effects-driven strategy
                        * an issues-driven strategy
                        * an opportunistic mix of all three

                        A '''goal-driven strategy''' focuses on achieving organizational goals in each scenario.

                        [[File:model_strategies_goal_driven.png|The goal-driven strategy]]

                        When applying this strategy, model developers...

                        * select an organizational goal in a segment
                        * add tasks to the segment that directly achieve the goal
                        * add tasks that produce information needed by other tasks in the segment
                        * and connect them with enabling flows

                        They repeat any or all of the above in all segments until...

                        * all relevant goals for all organizations in scope are listed
                        * all goals are achieved
                        * and all information needs are met

                        This strategy has pros and cons.

                        Pros: All tasks contribute directly or indirectly to achieving goals.
                        Cons: Event-triggered tasks might be ignored.

                    <description>
                        An '''effects-driven strategy''' focuses on the consequences of events and on the impacts of communicating.

                        [[File:model_strategies_effects_driven.png|The effects-driven strategy]]

                        When applying this strategy, model developers...

                        * select a segment covering a planning scenario
                        * and in that segment, they define tasks that are
                        ** directly triggered (no communications required) by the start of the segment's scenario
                        ** or are ongoing.

                        For each task, developers...

                        * indicate if it can cause an event or terminate the segment
                        * connect it to tasks it triggers or terminates via notifications or requests.

                        Developers repeat the above until nothing is caused, triggered or terminated.

                        This strategy has pros and cons.

                        Pros: Cause and effect relationships are more reliably captured.
                        Cons: Some tasks might not contribute to achieving goals.

                        An ''issues-drive''' focuses on strategy focuses on eliminating or waiving outstanding issues until none are outstanding.

                        [[File:model_strategies_issues_driven.png|The issues-driven strategy]]

                        When applying this strategy, model developers...

                        * select an issue, prioritizing...
                        ** validity issues
                        ** then completeness issues
                        ** and finally robustness issues
                        * waive an issue, if it is a “false positive” and it can be waived
                        * or resolve the issue
                        ** possibly by applying one of the proposed fixes
                        ** and after surveying stakeholders as necessary

                        Developers repeat the above until no issues, detected by Channels or reported by developers, are left outstanding.

                        This strategy has pros and cons.

                        Pros: Channels will find issues that people would easily miss.
                        Cons: An issue-free collaboration model is not necessarily the right one.

                        [[File:surveys_page.png|Surveys page]]

                        You can...

                        * see the surveys you need to complete
                        ** and optionally complete them [[File:surveys_filling.png|Filling out a survey]], decline them or forward them,
                        * see those you completed
                        ** and revise you answers if you so wish,
                        * and see those you declined
                        ** and perhaps change your mind about that.

                    <description>Collaboration Planning is the process by which organizations decide and agree on how they will coordinate, share information
                        and allocate material assets in anticipated scenarios so that they can manage risks and capture opportunities.

                        Collaboration planning captures and disseminates as collaboration plans...

                        * the commitments of responsible individuals
                        * in anticipated planning scenarios
                        * to communicate and share information
                        * and allocate material assets
                        * so that co-dependent organizations
                        * can successfully coordinate and inform
                        * tasks that achieve mission-critical goals
                        * in compliance with applicable policies.

                        The mission of collaboration planning is to help even strangers become successful collaborators at the very onset of crises
                        or the dawn of opportunities.

                        The collaboration planning process is iterative. [[File:collaboration_planning_process.png|The collaboration planning process]]

                        It consists of...

                        * Scoping future collaborations
                        * Building a collaboration model
                        * Creating and localizing a collaboration community
                        * Managing participation in the collaboration community
                        * Accessing collaboration checklists

                        A collaboration plan can be defined as the sum of all collaboration checklists (documenting expected collaboration behaviors)
                        assigned to and accepted by the participants in a collaboration community.

                    <description>A collaboration community defines how identified individuals in positions of responsibility within organizations
                        are expected to act, communicate and allocate material assets in anticipated planning scenarios.

                        [[File:collaboration_community_illustration.png|Collaboration community ]]

                        A collaboration community  is based on a production version of a collaboration model. [[File:collaboration_community_based_on_model.png|Collaboration community s are based on collaboration models]]

                        The model defines...

                        * the planning scenarios,
                        * the collaborators and their organizations,
                        * the tasks that directly or indirectly mitigate risks or achieve goals,
                        * the communications that coordinate and inform the tasks,
                        * the allocation of material assets,
                        * and the checklists detailing when and how to execute the tasks and communicate.

                        The collaboration model is defined using "placeholders" for...

                        * organizations (organization placeholders),
                        * people and systems (agents)
                        * material assets (asset placeholders)
                        * and places (location placeholders).

                        A collaboration community  adopting a model identifies...

                        * the locations of location placeholders,
                        * the organizations participating as organization placeholders,
                        * an actual asset for each material asset placeholder
                        * and users (and systems) participating as agents in positions of responsibility within participating organizations.

                        More than one collaboration community  can adopt a given collaboration model.

                        As placeholders from the collaboration model are identified in  collaboration community  by users and organizations,
                        checklists are personalized with contact information and are assigned to users based on their responsibilities.

                        Any authorized user of Channels can create a collaboration community  based on a published
                        collaboration model. This user automatically becomes a planner for this community
                        and has ultimate authority over the registration of organizations into the community , their participation
                        and the participation of users in positions of responsibility within these organizations.

                        A collaboration planner can define requirements on the plan that are to be fulfilled via adequate participation
                        by organizations and users. A planner can also view (but not modify) the collaboration model
                        upon which the community  is based and can see all issues detected in the community .

                        Non-planners can elect to participate in a collaboration community . Those who participate as agents that supervise
                        other agents have authority over the participation of users as these agents.

                    <description>A collaboration model captures how organizations would collaborate in anticipated scenarios.
                        It expresses collaboration rules and practices in terms of roles and it uses placeholders to
                        represent what might change during a collaboration or according to its context.

                        [[File:collaboration_model_illustration.png|A collaboration model captures generally applicable collaboration rules and practices]]

                        A collaboration model is defined in terms of...

                        * tasks required to achieve objectives in identified planning scenarios,
                        * the communications that coordinate and inform these tasks,
                        * the allocation of assets required for the execution tasks and communications
                        * how to assign tasks to individuals assigned on the basis of their positions in organizations
                        * checklists detailing how to execute each task and how to coordinate and inform their execution via communication and information sharing

                        A model identifies the organizations it involves either as ''known organizations'' - real-life
                        organizations - or as ''placeholder'' - organizations which real identities are to be given in
                        the collaboration community s that adopt the model.

                        A model also identifies the positions (aka organizational roles) that make up the collaborating
                        organizations. Users participate in the collaboration community s based on a model by being assigned to one or more positions defined in the model.

                        A collaboration model has versions. [[File:collaboration_model_versions.png|Collaboration model versions]] The most current version is the development version, accessible only to its developers and guests (who can only look but not touch). A development version can be put into production. Communities can only adopt the latest production version of a model.

                    <description>An organization is a group of individuals in positions of responsibility forming an administrative unit
                        that has a name and a mission.

                        An organization can be a corporation, a government agency, a department, a project team, a platoon etc.

                        An organization can contain sub-organizations.

                        The organizations known to a collaboration community consist of...

                        * All the known organizations (as opposed to ''placeholder'' organizations) that are identified in the collaboration model adopted by the community
                        * All (known) organizations registered in the community  only
                        * All (known) organizations registered in all communities hosted by the Channels service

                        An organization lists the positions that are relevant to the collaboration and to which it has given roles of responsibility.

                    <description>A placeholder is an organization, place, individual or material asset whose final identity is not known
                        to a collaboration model but is known to collaboration communities based on it.

                        A placeholder for an individual is called a position in a collaboration community.

                        A location placeholder that sets the overall locale for a collaboration community must be instantiated
                        with an actual location for the community to be opened for participation.

                        Material asset placeholders allow each collaboration community to give a unique identity to
                        assets defined in the collaboration model. For example, a model might define a "Standard Secure Radio"
                        asset placeholder. Each community can substitute it with their own standard secure radio equipment.

                        Most often than not, the term placeholder when used alone is used as a shorthand for organization placeholder.

                        The collaboration model upon which a collaboration community is based identifies all the
                        organizations that are involved in the collaboration it defines. Because each collaboration community
                        may involve its own, local organizations, model developers will often keep the identity of
                        organizations ''to be determined'' by making them ''placeholder'' organizations.

                        A placeholder organization from a collaboration model, for example "The Municipal Police Department",
                        can be associated to one or more organizations known to a collaboration community, for example, "Gotham Police Department".

                        [[File:organizations_participate_as_placeholders.png|Organizations participate in a community as placeholders defined in a model]]

                        A collaboration model may identify one of the positions in organizations it defines as
                        a ''custodian'' for a placeholder organization. If so, any user participating in a community in this
                        position is authorized to associate an organization known to the community with the model' placeholder
                        organization, in effect, involving the known organization in the collaboration defined for the placeholder
                        organization by the model.

                        Note that a planner acts as the default custodian for all placeholder organizations.

                <item>
                    <description>A position is a role assigned and title given to an individual by an organization.

                        A position in an organization can be filled by one individual and, sometimes, by or more functionally indistinguishable
                        individuals.

                        [[File:participation_in_position.png|A user can participate in a community by filling a position]]

                        A position in an organization usually translates to task assignments and communication commitments
                        documented as checklists.

                        [[File:assignments_commitments_from_participation.png|Assignments and commitments from participation in a position]]

                        It is possible that by holding a (primary) position in an organization, a user will automatically
                        be assigned to ''linked'' positions in other organizations.

                        For example, a "Chief of Police" at some municipal police department (primary position) could,
                        according to a collaboration model, be automatically assigned to a position of "Member" of the county's
                        "Emergency Operations Center" (linked position). Thus a Chief of Police would have not only the jobs of a chief of police
                        but also all the jobs of a member of the county's emergency operations center.

                        [[File:linked_position.png|Linked position]]

                        Users participate in a collaboration community by being assigned to one or more positions.

                        How many and which users can be assigned to a given position (and by who) depends on how
                        the position was defined by the developers of the model.

                        Some positions allow unrestricted self-assignment by users, others require confirmation by supervisors or planners,
                        yet others require some prior, confirmed employment. A position might allow only one user being assigned to it, another might allow any number.

                        The checklists collaboration checklists a user gets depends on the (accepted and confirmed) positions the user has.
                        The checklists are personalized with the contact names and information of other users participating
                        in positions this user will collaborate with.

                    <description>The participation in a collaboration community is the sum of all organizations and users involved in it.

                        A known organization defined in the collaboration model upon which the collaboration community is
                        based automatically participates (as itself) in the community.

                        When an organization is registered in a community, it does not yet participate in the collaboration
                        defined by the model on which the community is based. Participation by an organization registered
                        in a community happens when the organization is associated with a placeholder in the model.

                        [[File:organizations_participate_as_placeholders.png|Organizations can participate as placeholders defined in a model]]

                        When a registered organization is associated with a placeholder organization in the model,
                        the registered organization gets a ''copy'' of all the positions in the placeholder organization.

                        For example, when "Gotham Police Department" in the community is associated with "Municipal Police department"
                        in the model, the position of "Chief at Gotham Police Department" is created as a copy of the
                        model-defined position of "Chief of Municipal Police Department".

                        [[File:positions_copied_from_placeholders.png|Organizations get positions from placeholders they fill]]

                        Users participate in a community by assigning themselves or by being assigned to one or more positions
                        in participating organizations.

                        When assigned to a position in an organization by someone else, a user must accept the assignment
                        before it becomes active. Assignment to a position may require confirmation by all users participating
                        in supervisory positions.

                <item>
                    <description>A checklist is a set of instructions to a user assigned to a task. The checklist indicates
                        when to execute the task and how to execute it, how to get needed information and
                        communicate information acquire while or from doing the task, what the relevant policies are and
                        what impacts a failing the task would have on the collaboration.

                        Each task in the collaboration model a collaboration community is based on has an associated checklist,
                        minus contact information, that details how to execute the task. The description of the task
                        may involve obtaining and supplying material assets.

                        When a user receives checklists from being assigned to positions assigned to tasks, the checklists
                        are personalized with contact names and information of other users who participate in positions the user collaborates with.

                        [[File:checklists_in_models_and_communities.png|Checklists defined in models are personalized in communities]]

                        A checklist is defined by the nature of the task, what triggers it and by the steps by which the task is best executed.

                        The triggers can be...

                        * nothing (if the task is ongoing),
                        * information self-acquired (observation of an event, for example),
                        * information to be researched to carry out another task also assigned to the user,
                        * information sent by another user (a notification)
                        * or information requested by another user (a query).

                        [[File:checklist_example.png|Sample checklist]]

                        The steps of a checklist can be communications (queries, notifications) or actions (other than communications) taken in executing the task.

                        A step can be required or optional. It might also depend on another having been completed and on some other conditions being present or absent, such as an information need being satisfied or the task having failed. A step can produce outcomes such as events or new information becoming shareable.

                        Keep in mind that the checklist is only a document; it is not an interactive to-do list (at least, not yet).

                    <description>A planning scenario describes anticipated circumstances that would introduce risks an opportunities to organizations who must then collaborate to mitigate those risks and/or seize those opportunities.

                        A planning scenario is defined as an event of significance (a change that matters somewhere in the world) that might happen, or is happening or has happened, possibly in the context of other event that are happening or have happened.

                        A collaboration community might address more than one, presumably related, planning scenarios.

                    <description>A collaboration requirement specifies expected communication between two organizations in a collaboration community.

                        The requirement specifies in more or less generic terms...

                        * the ''source'' and ''sink'' organizations,
                        * the information to be communicated
                        * the planning scenario in which this communication is to happen
                        * the number of positions in each organization sending and receiving the information
                        * the number of alternate source-positions for each sink-positions

                        A collaboration requirement may or may not apply to a pair of organizations in the community.
                        If it does then, whether or not it can be realized according to the model-defined collaboration is examined and reported.

                    <description>
                        A material asset is typically something physical and costly to replicate (unlike information which
                        is ethereal and infinitely replicable) and that is needed for the execution of a task
                        or for communicating using a transmission medium that requires it.

                        A task can produce, use and possibly consume material assets. A material asset used
                        by a task can be merely useful (nice to have) or critical (must have) to the task.

                        Material assets are owned by organizations and can be provisioned to agents, usually upon request.
                        If an organization is said to stock some given material assets, then it is assumed that the
                        production and replenishment of these assets may not be necessary.

                        A material asset is available to an agent executing a task if...

                        * The task produces it
                        * The organization - on behalf of which the assigned agent executes the task - stocks it
                        * Agents assigned to another task supplies the asset to the agent
                        * The asset is made available to a task that is necessarily executed prior to this one, this prior task is assigned to the agent and it does ''not'' consume the asset

                        A task A precedes another task B if...

                        * task A  directly or indirectly triggers task B
                        * task A is ongoing in the same scenario or is initiated by the same scenario that "contains" task B
                        * task A is a scenario that always preceded the scenario for task B (for example responding to an event precedes recovering from that event)

                        A material asset can be dependent on other material assets, meaning all dependent assets of a
                        required asset must be acquired for it to be of use to a task.

                        A request for material assets is done via a notification or information request initiated
                        by the agents assigned to a task. The request is addressed to the agents being contacted.

                        The supply of material assets is associated with a notification of a reply to an information
                        request. The agents supplying the assets are those executing the task that "sent" the notification
                        or reply. The recipients of the assets are the agents assigned to the task that "receives"
                        the notification or reply.

                        A request received by agents assigned to a task can be forwarded to agents in another task in which case
                        any supplying in done in return will bypass the request forwarders and be made directly to agents
                        who made the original requests.

                        References to material assets will appear in checklists for each task that produces them,
                        requires them, receives them or supply them.

                        A material asset is implemented as a kind of domain entity - agents, organizations, events,
                        places, functions, transmission media etc. are also domain entities. material asset are created
                        when first referenced by name in the collaboration model, just like any other domain entity.
                        And just like organizations and places, an actual material asset can be marked as a placeholder
                        to be resolved in collaboration communities.

                        whether or not they are open for participation yet.

                        You can...

                        * create a new collaboration community by first selecting the production version of a collaboration model on which the community is to be based, and then pressing the "Start it" button - you will be the founding planner for this community,
                        * access a collaboration community visible to you (select the Go button next to its name in the list of communities).

                    <description>The collaboration community page is the home page of a collaboration community.

                        As a user, you can decide to participate in positions (roughly, organizational roles) that are open to participation by all.

                        [[File:community_user_managing_participation.png|User-managed participation]]

                        If you created the collaboration community, you are the initial collaboration planner for this community.
                        As such, you can authorize other users as planners and, if you wish and are not the only one, resign your planner privileges.

                        [[File:community_planner_authorizing.png|Authorizing planners]]

                        A newly created collaboration community is initially closed for participation. As a planner, you
                        decide when to open it (or later close it) for participation. The collaboration plan can not be opened
                        for participation [[File:community_opening_participation.png|Opening a community for participation]]
                        until the model's locale has been given an actual location, if it is a placeholder.

                        As a planner, you can name the community, describe it and localize it.
                        You can also update it to a new version of the collaboration model if one is detected by Channels.

                        [[File:community_setting_up.png|Setting up a collaboration community]]

                        As a planner you can set collaboration requirements for the collaboration community.
                        An issue is raised by Channels for each requirement that is not met.

                        [[File:community_requirements_page.png|Community requirements page]]

                        A community is localized by resolving placeholder places from the model to known locations.
                        At a minimum, the placeholder locale of the adopted model, if identified, needs
                        to be resolved. Until it is, a planner can not open the community for participation.

                        [[File:model_locale.png|Collaboration model locale]]

                        A community can also give a community-specific identity to any of the material asset placeholders
                        defined in its collaboration model.

                        As a planner, you are automatically a guest of the adopted collaboration model. If you are a guest or
                        a developer of the collaboration model upon which the community is based, you can access it.

                        As a planner, you can register organizations for potential participation into the community (or in
                        all communities), in addition to the known organizations defined by the community's collaboration model
                        (they automatically participate).

                        [[File:community_registering_orgs.png|Registering organizations in a community]]

                        You can then assign known organizations (registered and from the model) to organization placeholders defined in the model.

                        [[File:community_participation_organizations.png|Managing organization participation in a community]]

                        You can also assign any and all users to positions that need to be filled.

                        [[File:community_participation_users.png|User filling into positions a community]]

                        As a planner, you can define requirements on the collaboration and visualize the extent
                        to which they are fulfilled given the current participation.

                        [[File:community_requirements_page.png|Community requirements]]

                        As a planner, you can view all issues detected in and reported about the collaboration community.
                        You can waive issues that are "waivable".

                        [[File:community_issues_managing.png|Managing a community's issues]]

                        You can also see all issues, with metrics, in the community issues report

                        [[File:community_issues_report.png||Community issues report]]

                        If, as a participant, you are assigned to a position where you supervise other positions, you can assign
                        users to these positions, subject to some constraints, and subject to they accepting the
                        assignment. You are also responsible for confirming these assignments in order to activate them.

                        [[File:community_participation_confirmation.png|Confirming supervised participation]]

                        As a participant, you can access your collaboration checklists.

                        [[File:community_checklists_accessing.png|Accessing the community's checklists]]

                        You can also access the surveys you take part in.

                        [[File:surveys_page.png|The surveys page]]

                        And you can access the replies to feedback you have provided.

                    If you do, then you can assign yourself or be assigned to positions in organizations participating in the community.

                    Assignments to positions will be subject to you accepting and, where appropriate, to being confirmed by supervisors.

                    Once you participate in a community, you can withdraw from participation, but only if you are not a planner
                    and if you have not accepted any position. </description>

                        Defining a collaboration requirement means specifying how organizations in a collaboration community are expected to communicate.

                        What the requirements want to enforce is '''not''' that participants will follow the directives
                        in their assigned collaboration checklists as defined in the collaboration model the collaboration community is based on;
                        it is assumed (rightly or wrongly) that they will.

                        What requirements want to enforce is that, given ''current participation'' in the community, and given
                        the checklists they currently have, certain organizations commit to communicate certain information
                        with certain others and that there will be sufficient redundancy in sources and targets.

                        A given requirement might apply to every possible pairing of known organizations in a collaboration community or
                        only to some pairs of organizations. A pair of organizations to which a requirement applies consists
                        of a "source" organization (the one who commits to communicate some information) and of a
                        "receiver" organization (the other organization, who would be receiving the information as per the commitment).

                        To be precise, a requirement defines a subset of all the communication commitments that currently exist between users participating in a community and asserts
                        that there will be, in that subset, enough sources, enough receivers and enough sources for each receiver.

                        One can think of the set of all communication commitments as the sum of all communication steps in all the checklists for all participants in a community.

                        A requirement specifies (or not) ...

                        * the information to be communicated
                        * the positions in organizations who would commit to communicating it and their numbers (the sources)
                        * the positions in organizations who would benefit from these commitments and their numbers (the receivers)
                        * the expected number of sources per receiver (redundancy of source for each distinct receiver)

                        Documents can be attached to a requirement and planners can report issues
                        about the definition of a requirement.

                        [[File:community_requirement_issues.png| Community requirement issues]]

                        If information to be communicated is not specified then any information will satisfy the requirement.
                        If the sources are not specified then any user in any position in any organization can be a source satisfying the requirements.
                        The same logic applies to receivers.

                        Information in required communication commitments can be specified by giving none, any, or all of...

                        * its name
                        * tags applied to information flows in the collaboration model from which the communication commitments are derived (any information from a flow tagged by all the given tags will match)
                        * element names (any information with all the named elements will match)

                        [[File:community_requirement_info.png|Community requirement - Specifying information]]

                        If the information is not specified, then all communication commitments would match the information requirement.

                        The identities of sources are specified by naming none, any, or all of...

                        * the agent (hiring position of users) acting as the source
                        * the organization the agent works for
                        * the placeholder organization the above organization participates as

                        [[File:community_requirement_sources.png|Community requirement - Specifying source]]

                        The commitments can be further specified in terms of how the sources would acquire the information to be communicated.
                        This is done by naming none, any or all of...

                        * the source task of the flow from which the commitment is derived
                        * tags applied on matching source tasks of flows from which commitments are derived
                        * the planning scenario in which the tasks are to be executed

                        If the sources are not specified, then all communication commitments would match the source requirement.

                        The requirement on sources also include the minimum, preferred minimum and an optional maximum number of different sources in all commitments
                        that match the requirement.

                        The receivers are specified similarly as to their identity. Similarly to sources,
                        the commitments can be further specified in terms of how the receivers would make use of the information to be communicated.
                        This is done by naming none, any or all of...

                        * the target task of the flow from which the commitment is derived
                        * tags applied to matching target tasks  of flows from which commitments are derived
                        * the planning scenario in which the tasks are to be executed

                        If the receivers are not specified then all communication commitments would match the receiver requirement.

                        The requirement on receivers also include the minimum, preferred minimum and an optional maximum number of receivers in
                        all commitments that match the requirement.

                        The required redundancy of distinct sources per receiver is defined in terms of a minimum, preferred,
                        and an optional maximum number.

                        Requirement analysis measures how well the requirements are satisfied by participation in the community.

                        [[File:community_requirement_analysis.png|Community requirement analysis]]

                        Analysis consists in doing the following for each requirement ...

                        * Identifying all pairs of organizations (sources and receivers) to which the requirement applies
                        * For each pair, gather all communication commitments between each pair of organizations that match the requirement
                        * Count the number of commitments between individuals who are members of these organizations and count how many distinct individuals act as sources and receivers.
                        * Check if there are enough distinct sources and receivers, and if there are enough sources per receiver.
                        * Rate how the pair of organizations fulfill the requirement in terms of the counts being above the absolute minimum, below the maximum (if set) or right on target with the preferred minimum.

                        The rating for a pair of organizations is:

                        * '''Impossible''' if the model can not produce commitments that match the requirement
                        * '''Negative''' if the minimum number of sources or receivers is not met or the maximum is exceeded (it set)
                        * '''Weak''' if the absolute minimum and maximum numbers of sources and receivers is verified but not the preferred minimum
                        * '''Strong''' if the absolute minimum and maximum numbers of sources and receivers is verified as well as the preferred minimum

                        A diagram shows organizations linked by one or more requirements that apply to them. It also shows whether those requirements are satisfied.

                       The requirements between each pair are listed below the diagram together the satisfaction ratings. It is possible to view all the
                        communication commitments between a pair of organizations that go toward satisfying a given requirement.

                       You can browse all organizations known to the collaboration community
                       (only organizations known to the collaboration community can participate in it.)

                       All non-placeholder organizations from the collaboration model the community is based on are always
                       known to the community (and to all communities based on the model).

                       To enable other organizations to participate in a community, planners must first register them locally
                       into the community (or globally into all communities) and then, optionally, profile them. Only planners
                       can register new organizations and change the profiles of registered organizations.

                       [[File:community_registering_orgs.png|Organizations registered and known to the community]]

                       An organization is registered into a community by giving its name and by indicating whether it is to be
                       known to the community alone or to all communities hosted
                       on the Channels server. The scope of registration of an organization can be modified later as long
                       as it does not conflict with its participation (a global registration for an organization can not
                       be reversed to a local registration if the organization already participates in many communities).

                       After the organization is registered, planners are expected to profile it.

                       A registered organization is profiled by...

                       * Changing its name
                       * Providing a brief description (optional)
                       * Giving its street address (optional)
                       * Stating its mission (optional)
                       * Identifying its parent organization (optional)
                       * Providing contact information for the organization as a whole

                       The profile of a known organization defined in the collaboration model can not be modified by planners.

                        For members of an organization to participate in a collaboration and get their checklists, their
                        organization must first participate in the community.

                        A non-placeholder organization from the collaboration model the community is based on already
                        participate "as themselves" in the community. Organization placeholders defined in the model
                        however await authorized participants in the community to identify which organizations known to the
                        community participate as these placeholders.

                        [[File:community_participation_organizations.png|Managing organization participation]]

                        A participant is authorized to associate a known organization to a placeholder organization if
                        that user is a planner or participates in a position that makes him/her a custodian of that
                        placeholder organization according to the model. The model can set a limit on the number of
                        organizations that can participate as a placeholder.

                        Once an organization is associated with a placeholder, that organization inherits copies of all
                        the hiring and linked positions of the placeholder. If an organization participates as many
                        placeholders, it inherits positions from all of them.

                        [[File:positions_copied_from_placeholders.png|Organizations inherit positions from placeholders]]

                        Users who expressed intent to participate in
                        the collaboration community can now be made given these hiring positions, subject to various constraints.

                        to do so by authorized users.

                        Depending on how a hiring position in an organization has been defined by the developers of the

                        assigned to the position by supervisors or by planners. A supervisor for a hiring position (if
                        the position has one) is any user who is participating in a position that supervises the hiring position.

                        [[File:community_participation_users.png|Managing user participation]]

                        A position might accept only one user or some number of users participating in it. This is set
                        by model developers in the model and can not be altered in a community by planners.

                        A user can participate in any number of positions. A user must accept a participation for it to be
                        effective. If the position participated in is supervised, all supervisors must also confirm the participation.

                        When a user participates in a hiring position (accepted and confirmed if need be), the user automatically
                        participates in all positions linked to the hiring positions. The linking of positions is set by
                        developers in the collaboration model of the community and can not be changed by planners.

                        Participation in a position can be terminated...

                        * by the participating user un-accepting the position (the participation request remains and can be re-accepted)
                        * by a supervisor un-confirming the participation (confirmation becomes pending again)
                        * by a supervisor or planner deleting the participation (the participation request is removed)

                        When a position is defined as supervised (in the collaboration model the community is based on),
                        participation by a user in that position only becomes effective when all users participating as
                        the supervisors of that position (immediately above in the chain of command) have confirmed
                        the participation.

                        As a participant, you are presented with all user participation that you either need to confirm or that
                        you have already confirmed. You then confirm participation or un-confirm participation you have confirmed.

                        As planner in a collaboration community, you can authorize any other user to also become a planner.

                        You can resign as planner if you are not the last one. You can not "resign" someone else unless
                        you are a Channels administrator.

                        Note that when a user creates a new collaboration community (any user can do this), that user becomes the first
                        and founding planner.

                        Collaboration community issues are detected automatically by Channels and refreshed every time a change is
                        made to the collaboration community.

                        Issues can have to do with...

                        * Missing or improper participation
                        * Incorrect organization profiles
                        * Community requirements not being satisfied
                        * Problem with the definition of a community requirement (entered by planners)
                        * The current collaboration model being obsolete (a new production version is available)
                        * Missing user contact information
                        * Unresolved problem communicated via user feedback

                        Planners can waive an issue if it can be waived ("waivability" depends on the kind of issue).

                    <description>The ''All Checklists'' page let's you access
                        all your collaboration checklists and those of all participants you are allowed to see.

                        [[File:community_checklists_accessing.png|All checklists page]]

                        If you are a planner, you can see the personalized checklists of all users and the generic checklists for all positions.

                        If you participate in a supervisory position, you can see the personalized checklists of all users participating in positions you supervise.

                        By clicking on a position, you access the checklists for those in that position. By clicking on a
                        participant's name, you access the combined checklists for all the positions assigned to the
                        participant in the community.

                        Note that for a user who participates in only one position, this page is skipped and the user will be taken directly to the Participant Checklist page.

                        A checklist describes...

                        * a task
                        * what events or communications trigger it (if any)
                        * the steps, with or without constraints, by which the task is executed, including
                        ** actions to be taken
                        ** queries, notifications and receipt confirmations to be made

                        ** self-assigned "follow up" tasks


                        The prescribed process for executing the steps can be viewed as a diagram.

                        Each checklist step can be expanded to see details about its execution, including contacts if it is a communication step.

                        Each contact is linked to a user profile and contact information in the contacts directory.

                        A contacts directory, at the bottom of the page, details the contacts of all communications in the checklist
                        and gives access to the chains of command of each contact.

                        A model element can be a segment, a task, a flow, a role, information etc. Model elements
                        are themselves defined in terms of other model elements.

                    <description>An event is a domain entity representing a transient change in the world that introduces
                        risks and/or opportunities for organizations.

                        Risks and events should not be confused. An event can introduce risks to one organization while
                        creating opportunities for another.

                        From the point of view of the model, an event is considered an ''incident'' if its occurrence
                        is not planned (it is an 'outside' event).

                    <description>A phase is a domain entity representing a time period relative to the occurrence of events. A
                        phase is either the time before, during or after events.

                        A collaboration model can address what happens before, during or after of events, or a
                        combination thereof. Each segment in a collaboration model focuses on one planning scenario
                        which is defined in terms of one phase of one event.

                    <description>The term ''planning scenario'' is used in collaboration planning to mean a phase of an
                        event being planned for, possibly occurring in the context of other past or current events.

                        A planning scenario is associated with risks and opportunities (gains to be achieved) for organizations.

                    <description>Goals are either risks to be mitigated or gains to be achieved by organizations.

                        In Channels, a goal is understood as a ''mission-level'' goal of one or more of the
                        organizations represented in a collaboration model. A goal, either a risk to be mitigated or an
                        opportunity to be seized, is the consequence of the onset or conclusion of an event.

                        Goals are achieved by successfully carrying out tasks, or they are automatically achieved when
                        an event terminates.

                        Mission-level goals are not to be confused with the implied and unstated goals of successfully
                        executing a task or sharing information.

                    <description>Collaboration models are composed of one or more or more segments. Each segment
                        addresses a list of organizational goals to be achieved in one planning scenario.

                        No two segments should address identical goals in identical planning scenarios.

                        Two segments are connected by the flows that span them and by how a task in one segment can
                        start or end an events, thus initiating the other segment.

                        A segment can be owned by one or more developers, or by none. If owned then only its owners
                        (and administrators) are allowed to modify it (in the development version of the model),
                        otherwise all developers can modify the segment.
                        A segment is initially owned by the developer who created it.
                        Ownership of a segment can be changed by its owners and by administrators.

                        medium.

                        Information is named and can be described by a list of its essential elements.

                        Information can be constrained to compliance with a named information product that defines a
                        standard list of elements of information.

                        Each element of information has a name, can be accompanied by handling instructions and be given
                        a secrecy classification.

                    <description>A task is an action or decision taken, individually or as a team, by agents
                        (people or systems) assigned to it.

                        A task's outcomes can be...

                        * an event triggered or terminated,
                        * goals achieved
                        * information acquired that can then be shared
                        * material assets produced and/or delivered

                        A task specifies what agents known to the collaboration models will be assigned to it and,
                        whether they will be executing the task individually or as a team.

                        A task can also specify where the task is to be executed, whether it repeats and how often it does,
                        and how the location will become known to the agents assigned to the task.

                        Each task is accompanied by a checklist that details how to execute the task.

                    <description>An information flow specifies how agents who carry out a task that ''produces'' information would commit to communicate
                        that information with agents carrying out a task that ''consumes'' it.

                        An information flow is defined in terms of...

                        * The information being communicated
                        * The source task where the information was acquired
                        * The target task where the information is consumed
                        * The impact (triggering, terminating, informing) of communicating the information on either source and target tasks
                        * The transmission media over which the information would be communicated
                        * The maximum acceptable delay between acquiring the information and communicating it
                        * Instructions, such as whether to also share the planning scenario in context
                        * Material assets requested (with forwarding or not) and supplied as a result

                        An information flow can connect tasks that are from different segments.

                    <description>A task's assignments is the list of agents known to the collaboration model that match
                        the assignment profile of the task.

                        The assignment profile specifies agents by naming (or not)...

                        * The actual agent
                        * A type of agent
                        * A role in which the agents are employed
                        * The place or type of place matching the jurisdiction of the employed agents
                        * An actual or type of organization employing the agents

                        [[File:task_assignments_computing.png|How agents are assigned to a task]]

                        Leaving an attribute of an assignment profile empty indicates that any value is acceptable. For example,
                        leaving the jurisdiction unspecified means that assignment is not restricted by jurisdiction.

                        More often than not, a task's assignment profile will not name a specific agent but will only name a role
                        and a type of organization.

                    <description>A communication commitment is the promise by one agent to communicate information acquired
                        to do or while doing a task with another agent who needs this information to initiate,
                        terminate or successfully execute some other task.

                        The communication commitments are derived from flows connecting tasks.
                        There is a communication commitment from each agent assigned to the source task to each agent
                        assigned to the target task such that the pair of agents respects the restrictions, if any, set on the flow
                        (in same organization, in different locations etc.)

                        It is recommended that info needs, capabilities and flows be defined in terms of information
                        products.

                    <description>A role is a domain entity representing a standard set of responsibilities that various
                        organizations can assign to its members.

                        A role, such as Manager, is different from a job title, such as Senior VP Sales. Unlike job titles,
                        roles are not meant to be included in checklists or anything else shown to participants in collaboration
                        communities based on the collaboration model.

                        Roles are always entity types and they can form taxonomies whereby a role has a narrower meaning than another.
                        For example, a manager would be categorized as an employee, meaning that all managers are employees
                        but not all employees are managers. Manager being narrower than employee, we say that manager ''inherits'' from employee.

                        Roles are used by model developers to define the jobs of agents in organizations and to specify
                        task assignment profiles that will match agents based on their direct or inherited roles.

                        Based on the example above, a task assigned to all employees would also implicitly be assigned
                        to all managers since a manager is also an employee. Clearly, great care must be taken in defining
                        the taxonomy of roles in a collaboration model.

                        An agent is a placeholder for participants in collaboration communities based on the collaboration model.

                        An agent can be employed by one or more organizations in titled positions, each specified by a
                        role.

                        Agent ''types'' are not to be confused with ''roles''. Agent types are used to categorize agents
                        independently of their roles. Agent types are typically used to represent qualifications.
                        Examples of agent types are "adult", "trained in CPR", "licensed diver" etc.

                    <description>A place is a domain entity used to represent an area in space, usually an administrative are.

                        A place is used to delimit jurisdictions of agents employed by organizations,
                        to locate where tasks are to be executed, where events are of significance, and where a collaboration model
                        is meant to apply (its locale, which is to be identified by each collaboration community based on the model).

                        A place can represent either an actual place ("Grand Central Station") or a type (category) of places
                        ("Rail Station").

                        An actual place is either a known place ("New York City") or a placeholder for a known place
                        (The Flooded City). The identity of a placeholder place (or placeholder location) is to be
                        resolved by each community adopting the model.

                        The use of placeholder places is required when...

                        * stating the scope of an event
                        * stating the default locale of the model as a whole

                        Place placeholders enables developers to co-reference a (to-be-determined) place in a model.
                        For example, a task could be defined as needing to be executed in the same location as the scope of the
                        event that triggered it. This would be done by using the same placeholder place as the scope of the
                        event and as the location of the task.

                        which agents communicate.

                        A transmission medium can be meant for broadcasting (to all), multicasting (to many but not all) or
                        narrowcasting (to one per communication).

                        A transmission medium can be stated to require the use one or more material assets. For example,
                        a "secure radio" transmission medium may require the use of a "secure radio system" asset.

                        A transmission medium is always a type (a category).

                        The triggers of a collaboration checklist are the triggers of the task as derived from its definition.

                        A task and thus its collaboration checklist can be triggered by assigned agents...

                        * becoming aware of an event (without being told),
                        * receiving notifications (being told without asking),
                        * receiving requests for information (being told after asking),
                        * doing and receiving nothing (if the task is always ongoing)

                    <description>A domain entity, or entity for short, is a grab bag term for collaboration model elements
                        that are "timeless things or concepts"
                        (as opposed to tasks and communicated information)

                        Domain entities are...

                        * agents
                        * events
                        * functions
                        * information formats
                        * information products
                        * material assets
                        * organizations
                        * phases
                        * places
                        * roles
                        * transmission media

                        Channels distinguishes between "actual" entities and "types" (or categories) of entities. For
                        example, IBM is an organization whereas "Corporation" is a type of organization.

                        Domain entities are automatically created when they are first named in the definition of some model
                        element. No two entities of the same kind can have the same name in a model.

                        Entities can be categorized by entity types of the same kind (IBM - an actual organization - is
                        a Corporation -a type of organization - but it can not be a Manager - a role).

                        Categorized entity types form taxonomies (a Police Chief is a Manager is an Employee).

                        Events, information formats, information products, phases, roles and transmission media are
                        always types in Channels.

                    <description>Communicating information can impact the status of tasks in different ways.

                        It can...

                        * trigger the task
                        * terminate the task
                        * be critical (crucial) to the task's success
                        * be useful

                        When doing failure impact analysis, only flows that trigger, terminate or are crucial to the
                        task's success are considered.

                    <description>A task is considered useful if it directly achieves a goal or if its failure would
                        prevent another task from achieving a goal.

                        Only useful tasks are considered when doing failure impact analysis. A useless task is
                        considered an issue by Channels.

                    <description>A survey is a questionnaire about a model element or the model as a whole sent to one or more participants.

                        Questions be optional and can have single or multiple answers. They can also allow free commentary.

                        Model developers can define surveys for various kinds of model elements (surveys about
                        tasks, about events, about the collaboration model as a whole etc.).

                        A survey is applied to one or more model elements of the appropriate kind (a task survey can
                        be applied to many tasks) and is then sent to one or more users with an optional deadline.

                        Recipients of surveys can accept and answer the survey and revise their answers at any time.
                        Recipients can decline a survey or forward it to their contacts, who are then automatically
                        registered as Channels users.

                <item>
                    <description>A tag is a word or phrase used to tag model elements in order to informally classify
                        them.

                        Tags can belong to tag domains. For example, ''esf:transportation'' is the tag
                        ''transportation'' in the tag domain ''esf''.

                        Tag domains can optionally be predefined by attaching specially formatted text ''tag'' text
                        files to the model.

                        A given tag can be applied without constraints to model elements of different kinds.

                        One use of tags is to specify information in collaboration requirements.

                <item>
                    <description>A collaboration checklist lists the steps required to successfully execute a task.

                        A step can be either...

                        * some stated activity (other than communicating)
                        * an information request to make,
                        * a notification to send,
                        * sending confirmation of information received,
                        * a self-assigned research sub-task
                        * a self-assigned follow up sub-task

                        [[File:model_checklist_editor_steps.png|Steps in a checklist]]

                        A step may be required or optional. A step may have identify the completion of other steps as
                        pre-requisites.

                        A step, to be executable, may also require that some stated conditions (an event phase, a goal
                        having been achieved, an information need having been satisfied, the task having failed) be
                        present or absent.

                        The communication steps of a checklist are implied by the flows in and out of a task, to and
                        from other agents(requested info to be received and notifications to be sent).

                        [[File:model_checklist_communication_steps.png|Communication steps from flows]]

                        If a flow triggers the task the checklist is for and if the flow is marked as requesting confirmation
                        of receipt, then a confirm receipt communication step is automatically added to the checklist.

                        The sub-task steps are implied by flows to self - research sub-tasks are triggering requests to
                        self and followup sub-tasks are triggering notifications to self.

                        [[File:model_checklist_subtask_steps.png|Subtask steps from flows]]

                        The conditions on executing steps can be the goals achieved and events triggered by the task,
                        material assets being available to the task, or other ad hoc conditions.

                        The outcomes of a task (events caused or terminated, goals achieved, sharing capabilities
                        acquired, material assets produced or supplied/delivered) can be associated with the execution of individual steps.

                        Channels will raise an issue whenever a condition or outcome from the definition of a task is
                        not referenced by at least one step, for example, when a goal achieved by the task is not
                        associated with a step in its checklist.

                    <description>A function specifies the goals to be achieved, the information needed and the
                        information to be acquired by any task implementing the function.

                        Functions are "entities" and so they can be categorized by other functions. Functions are always
                        entity "types"; there is no such thing as an "actual" function.

                        [[File:function_and_tasks_illustration.png|Tasks can implement functions]]

                        A task may or may not declare that it implements a function. If it does, it is expected to
                        conform to the specifications of the function. Issues are raised if the task does not fully do
                        so.

                    <description>As a model developer, you can access collaboration model editor and a summary report
                        on all issues found in the model.

                        [[File:model_page.png|A collaboration model home page]]

                        As a developer or authorized user you can access the planning surveys you participate in and the
                        feedback you provided.

                        Documents that have been attached to the model are directly accessible. New ones can be
                        added.

                        You can switch to another model - or another version of this model - by mousing over the
                        name of the model in the "breadcrumbs" at the top of the page. A drop-down menu of models
                        will appear. If this page was accessed from a collaboration community, only the versions of the
                        community-adopted collaboration model are accessible.

                        * report issues in addition to those automatically detected by Channels
                        * view analytics to better understand the consequences, strengths and weaknesses of the model

                <item>
                    <description>The scope of the collaboration model is determined in part by the planning scenarios
                        it addresses. A planning scenario is defined in terms of the phase (before, during or after) of
                        an event and by the event itself. For examples, planning scenarios could be responding during an
                        earthquake (the event), or recovering after an earthquake.

                        [[File:model_scoping_events_phases.png|Naming all events and event phases in scope]]

                        The list of all events and phases within the scope of a model thus determines what planning
                        scenarios are within the scope of the collaboration model.

                        The ''All events and phases'' panel allows you to see all events and phases referenced the
                        model and to directly add new ones, as well as delete any not yet referenced.

                        The ''Events'' tab gives access to the list of all events in scope. A new event event can be
                        added by naming it. Since the event is not referenced anywhere else (yet) in the model, it is
                        considered an ''incident'', that is, an external event not caused by a planned task. Its
                        ''incident'' status can only be changed once there is a task that causes it. Events referenced
                        in the model, other than in this panel, can not be removed from the list.

                        The ''Phases'' tab gives access to the list of all event phases in scope. A new phase can be
                        added by naming it. A phase not yet referenced anywhere else in the model can be deleted.

                        Note that Channels will expect to see at least one segment for each combination of phase and event in scope.

                    <description>All segments in the model are grouped either by event or by phase. They are
                        connected by cross-segment flows and by causation links.

                        [[File:model_all_segments.png|All segments in a model, grouped and connected]]

                        A cross-segment flow is a flow from a task in one segment to a task in another. A causation link
                        is an event caused or terminated by a task in one segment that sets the conditions for another
                        segment.

                        You can drill down on the cross-segment flows and on the causation links.

                        A segment can be owned by one or more developers, or by none. If it is owned, then only its owners (and
                        administrators) can make changes to the segment, including removing it.

                        [[File:segment_ownership.png|Managing segment ownership]]

                        If it is not owned by anyone then all developers (and administrators) can modify the segment.

                        Modifications to a segment controlled by ownership include...
                        * changing its details (name, description, tags etc.)
                        * changing its planning scenario
                        * changing its goals
                        * adding or removing owners (an owner can resign his/her own ownership)

                        A segment is initially owned by the developer who added it to the collaboration model.

                        To access a task's form, select the task in the flow map and then click on its summary to reveal
                        the task's definition form. You can toggle between a simple form (only basic fields are shown)
                        and advanced form (all fields are shown).

                        Tags set on a task can be used, among other things, to categorize the assignments that are derived from it. These tags
                        can be used in defining collaboration requirements in a collaboration community.

                        be able to share with others, and how and how quickly.

                        A flow connecting one task to another can be built by first creating an information capability and
                        then identifying a target task.

                        [[File:model_capability_to_flow.png|From capability to flow]]

                        Information flows, needs and capabilities are defined by mostly the same attributes.

                        * setting restrictions based on the relationships (employment, location, authority, identity) between sources and targets [[File:model_flow_restrictions.png|Restrictions on a flow]]
                        * the communication channels to use, each including transmission medium and, optionally, a required format [[File:model_flow_channels.png|Communication channels]]
                        * timeliness constraints [[File:model_flow_timing.png|Communication timeliness]]
                        * whether the flow is repeated and how often
                        * if a flow to a ''middleman'', whether it can be bypassed [[File:model_flow_bypassing_intermediate.png|Permission to disintermediate]]
                        * identifying the material assets to be requested (forwarding or not) and supplied as a result
                        * and documenting it [[File:model_flow_documentation.png|Documenting a send or receive]]

                        A flow is defined by first adding an information need and then identifying a source task, or by
                        first adding an information capability and then identifying a target task.

                        [[File:model_flow_source_target.png|Identifying a source or target task]]

                        What is to be communicated in a send or receive is a combination of...

                        * the information that justifies the communication
                        * if allowed, the context in which the communication is made, namely, the current planning scenario

                        Tags set on a flow can be used, among other things, to categorize the commitments that are derived from it. These tags
                        can be used in defining collaboration requirements in a collaboration community.

                        An information need or capability can be marked as ''private'', in which case it is not to be communicated
                        to participants in a collaboration community. This will come into play when Channels supports the execution
                        of plans.

                    <description>You can list the essential elements of information of an information need, capability
                        or flow, and set their properties.

                        The properties of an element of information are...

                        * its name
                        * the question it answers
                        * its security classification
                        * its handling instructions
                        * if produced, how it transforms , if at all, received elements
                        * if defining an info need, whether its delivery is subject to timeliness constraints

                        [[File:model_flow_eois.png|Defining the elements of information]]

                        If the information to be sent or received is standardized as an information product, then the send/receive
                        inherits the information product's elements of information. Other elements of information can be added
                        that are specific to the send/receive but this is discouraged.

                    <description>An information sharing flow connect a tasks that ''produces'' information with a tasks
                        that ''consumes'' it. It is equivalent to connecting an info capability of a task with the info
                        need of another.

                        [[File:model_flow_source_target.png|Identifying a source or target task]]

                        A sharing flow is created by connecting an info need or a capability to a task. The flow appears
                        in the ''Receives'' of the consuming task and in the ''Sends'' of the producing task.

                        Tasks in different segments can only be connected via their respective, defined information need and
                        information capability. You might want to thin of information needs and capabilities as defining
                        the "flow connecting interface" of segments.

                        [[File:flows_across_segments.png|Connecting tasks with flows across segments]]

                        Channels can be asked to automatically create flows by connecting all tasks with matching
                        information capabilities and needs, within and across segments. This is done by using the
                        menu item ''Satisfy all needs'' in a task's actions menu.

                <item>
                    <description>You can see the list of all tasks that either override this task or are overridden by it.

                        [[File:model_task_overrides.png|List of overridden tasks]]

                        A task is said to override another if the task names are the same (case is unimportant) and if the
                        agent assignment profile of the first task narrows the assignment profile of the other task.

                        [[File:model_task_overriding.png|How a task overrides another]]

                        In other words, any agent assigned to the overriding task would also be assigned to the overridden
                        task but not vice-versa. For example, a task "Detect threats" assigned to all Managers overrides
                        a task "Detect threats" assigned to all Employees because a Manager is an Employee but an Employee
                        is not necessarily a Manager.

                        If an agent is assigned to a task that overrides another task, it is '''not''' assigned to the
                        overridden task. in the above example, an agent who is a Manager would be assigned to only one task,
                        the one profiled for Managers, not the task profiled for Employees, even though the agent matches it
                        too.

                    <description>A checklist comes pre-populated with steps representing the requested information to be
                        received, the notifications to be sent, the research and follow-up sub-tasks that are defined
                        for the task as flows.

                        [[File:model_checklist_editor.png|Checklist editor]]

                        These communication steps can not be removed from the checklist. Action steps, representing
                        simple activities requiring no communication or new information, can be added and removed.

                        A step can be given...

                        * Prerequisite steps - steps the step must come "after"
                        * Conditions that must be present for the step to be taken ("if")
                        * Conditions that must be absent for the step to be taken ("unless")
                        * Outcomes from the execution of a step

                        Action steps (not communication steps) can be marked as "required", else they are optional.
                        Communication and sub-task steps are marked as required if they are notifications or follow-ups.

                        Conditions applicable on steps are either...

                        * Goals achieved by the task
                        * Events triggered or terminated by the task
                        * Information needs of the task
                        * The task having failed (a non-optional condition for "on-failure notification steps)
                        * Needed material assets being available
                        * Conditions ''local'' to the execution of the task added to the checklist - they can also be removed

                        Outcomes of a steps can be...

                        * Goals, if any, achieved by the task
                        * Events, if any, caused or terminated by the task
                        * Sharing capabilities acquired for or from successfully executing the task
                        * Material assets produced or supplied (delivered)

                        [[File:model_checklist_step_editor.png|Editing a step in a checklist]]

                        A checklist must be confirmed to be deployed to participants as such. Any change to the implied
                        communication steps or to the action steps requires a re-confirmation.

                        A process flow describing the execution of the checklist is accessed by clicking on the flow
                        icon next to the name of the task. The process flow shows all steps, their pre-conditions and outcomes
                        as icons set between a start and stop icons. The process diagram shows when steps can be executed in no
                        particular order or in a sequence.

                        The green dot represents start of execution and the red dot its end. Execution is from left to
                        right.

                        Steps that can be executed in parallel are depicted in parallel. Steps that must precede one
                        another are depicted in sequences.

                        Steps that are executed conditionally are preceded by ''if'' and/or ''unless'' conditions. If
                        there is more than one condition constraining a step, the conditions precede the step in a
                        sequence.

                        The outcomes of steps are shown linked to the steps.

                        An actual organization employs agents in roles with jurisdiction that must be identified
                        if they are to be assigned to tasks.

                        An actual organization can be declared a placeholder, meaning its identity (or identities)
                        will be decided in each collaboration community that adopts the model where the organization is defined.

                    <description>An actual organization can be declared as a placeholder, meaning that its possibly many
                        real-world identities will be set by communities adopting the model.

                        One or more known organizations in a collaboration community can participate as the planned placeholder
                        organization. The participating organization inherits (a copy of) the agents employed by the
                        placeholder.

                        The custodian of a placeholder organization is the agent authorized to register known
                        organizations as participating as the placeholder. Whoever in a community participates as this agent is an acting
                        custodian. Collaboration planners are by default acting custodians.

                        * any number of users can participate as the agent
                        * or exactly one user can participate
                        * or at most a specified number of users can participate

                        Furthermore, who can participate as the agent can be set to...

                        * any user whatsoever (open participation)
                        * or users confirmed in their participation by other users participating as the agent's supervisors
                        * or users already participating as agents employed by one of the agent's organizations

                        Participation can be anonymous, in which case the names and contact information of participating
                        users will not appear in the checklists of other users.

                    <description>Define a function that tasks can implement.

                        A function can be...

                        * named
                        * described
                        * categorized by other (more generic) functions

                        A function defines the kinds of goals, if any, a task implementing it is expected to achieve, as
                        well as the information needs and information capabilities that such a task is expected to have
                        in order to conform to the function.

                        The goals specified by a function are goal categories plus whether they are risks to be
                        mitigated or gaines to be made.

                        The information needs and capabilities specified by the function are named, optionally point to
                        an information product, and define function-specific elements of information.

                        When a function is categorized by other functions, it adds to the goals, information needs and
                        information capabilities that the categorizing functions define.

                        * categorized by (more generic) types of material asset

                        A material asset can identify other material assets (types of actual) it depends on to be effective.

                        A material asset type can define named property fields to be used in further describing actual material assets
                        categorized by this asset type.

                        An actual material asset can give values to its property fields.

                    <description>Collaboration checklists are computed by assigning agents to tasks and by deriving
                        communication commitments from the flows connecting assigned tasks.

                        A key concern is making sure that the right agents get assigned to the right tasks, and that
                        only the right agents that are assigned to the tasks on each side of a flow become parties to
                        communication commitments.

                        Which agents are assigned to a task is determined by...

                        * how a task specifies the agents assignable to it
                        * what agents are in the model's environments and how they are profiled
                        * how the agents are employed (role, jurisdiction, organization)
                        * how the taxonomies of role, agent, organization etc. are defined

                        * what restrictions are put on pairing agents into commitments (the committer and beneficiary must be in the same organization etc.)
                        * whether an overriding flow prohibits a pairing of agents

                    <description>Entities (i.e. roles, agents, organizations, places, events etc.) can be categorized.
                        Agents are categorized by agent types, organization by organization types, events by other
                        events (events are always types) etc.

                        [[File:model_improving_taxonomies.png|Validating domain entity taxonomies]]

                        How entities are categorized largely determine the meaning of the tasks, flows, employments etc.
                        that are defined in terms of these entities.

                        The meaning of a model boils down to the task assignments and consequent communication commitments
                        (checklists) that are implied by the collaboration model.

                        Even a small change to the taxonomy (a.k.a. typology) or roles, for example, can cause
                        widespread changes to the checklists computed from a model, and thus its meaning.

                        Taxonomies are defined implicitly by categorizing individual entities. The best way to verify
                        that taxonomies are correct is to visualize them.

                    <description>A ''flow map'' shows tasks connected by flows where each flow can imply a potentially
                        large number of communication commitments. The ''checklists map'' makes it easy to see if the sharing
                        commitments generated from the model are the intended ones.

                        [[File:model_improving_checklists_map.png|Using the checklists map]]

                        The map is focused on one agent or one organization (as an aggregate of agents). It shows the
                        commitments that involved that agent or organizations.

                        The other parties to the commitments can be aggregated (summarized) by role, organization type or not at all.

                        Clicking on an assigned task navigates to the task's definition and opens the checklist flow
                        diagram for this task.

                        [[File:model_improving_supply_chains.png|Material asset supply chains]]

                        The task assignments in supply chains can be aggregated (summarized) by role, organization type or not at all.

                        A material asset is available to agents assigned to a task if the assets are made available to them
                        assigned to another task that necessarily precedes the task. Availability from prior tasks can optionally be shown.

                        "Orphan" task assignments can also optionally be shown. "Orphan" task assignments are those that
                        produce or use material assets (to execute or communicate) but are not part
                        of displayed supply chains or prior availability relationships.

                        You compose questionnaires by adding, ordering, editing etc. statements and questions. Questions
                        can be marked as required or optional.

                        A questionnaire applies to the model as a whole or to one kind of model element (model
                        questionnaire, task questionnaires, event questionnaires etc.)

                        Questionnaires can be activated and deactivated. They can be extended while they are being used
                        in surveys.

                    <description>Surveys can be launched on an issue that was detected. The questionnaire is
                        automatically generated based on the remediation options.

                        [[File:model_learning_survey_launching_issue.png|Launching an issue remediation survey]]

                        The questionnaire can be modified and extended while the survey is ongoing.

                        An issue remediation survey is automatically deactivated when the issue disappears.

                        Note that the issue remediation questionnaires are by default not shown in the list of all
                        questionnaires; a checkbox must be checked to see them.

                    <description>Once a survey is launched, users can be invited to participate in it. Users can be
                        given a deadline to answer all of the required questions in a survey.

                        [[File:model_learning_survey_participation.png|Managing participation in a survey]]

                        After the deadline has passed, the survey is considered late. Late participants can be
                        ''nagged'' (nags are sent by email).

                        A participant can...

                        *accept the invitation by answering questions,
                        *decline the invitation
                        *forward the survey to others (if it was marked as forwardable).

                        Note that anyone who is forwarded a survey and who is not yet a user of Channels is
                        automatically given a login, password and limited access to the model as a participant.

                        For example, at the bottom of in the profile of a role is an index of all other model
                        elements that reference the role or that match the role.

                    <description>As an administrator, you manage models and users for a Channels server.

                        Model management consists of...

                        * Creating a new model with a unique resource identifier (URI)
                        * Deleting a model - permitted only if not yet adopted by a collaboration community
                        * Putting the current development version of a model into production
                        * Naming the owner of the model
                        * Changing the default email addresses at which user or developer feedback is sent

                        User management consists of...

                        * Adding a new user with a unique username - be aware that users can not be deleted, only disabled
                        * Giving a user a full name, email address and password - the user can later modify all of these
                        * Making the user as an admin
                        * Disabling the user - this can be later reversed
                        * Giving the user developer vs guest (view-only) status for specific collaboration models.
