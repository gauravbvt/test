                    <description>Channels is an online collaboration planning service.

                        It enables
                        * analysts to develop best-practice templates for information sharing-enabled collaboration,
                        * planners to setup localized collaboration plans based on collaboration templates,
                        * users to participate in collaboration plans and get collaboration checklists instructing
                        their participation,
                        * administrators to manage the Channels service.

                        to answer surveys in order to help improve a collaboration template.

                        You can

                        * see the surveys you need to complete
                        ** and optionally complete them, decline them or forward

                        ** and revise you answers if you so wish,
                        * and see those you declined
                        ** and perhaps change your mind about that.

                    <description>A collaboration plan prescribes how organizations and individuals working for them are expected to collaborate in one or more planning scenarios.

                        The collaboration is to be realized via the execution of tasks assigned to individuals, based on their organizational roles, and coordinated through communications and information sharing.

                        Checklists document how to execute each assigned task, including which which communications to make, when how and to who.

                        A collaboration plan is based on a collaboration template that defines the planning scenarios, the kinds of collaborators, the tasks, the communications that coordinate them, and the checklists for executing the collaboration.

                    <description>A collaboration template defines a best-practice collaboration between and within organizations in terms of

                        * tasks required to achieve objectives in identified planning scenarios,
                        * the communications that coordinate and inform these tasks,
                        * how to assign tasks to individuals assigned on the basis of their positions in organizations
                        * checklists detailing how to execute each task and how to coordinate and inform their execution via communication and information sharing

                    A template identifies the organizations it involves either as ''known organizations'' - real-life organizations - or as ''placeholder'' - organizations which real identities are to be given in the collaboration plans that adopt the template.

                        A template also identifies the positions (aka organizational roles) that make up the collaborating organizations. Users participate in the collaboration plans based on a template by being assigned to one or more positions defined in the template.

                        A collaboration template has versions. The most current version is the development version, accessible only to its developers and guests (who can only look but not touch). A development version can be put into production. Plans can only adopt the latest production version of a template.

                    <description>A collaboration plan involves organizations and individuals holding positions in them (organizational roles).

                        The organizations known to a plan consist of:

                        * All the known organizations (as opposed to ''placeholder'' organizations) that are identified in the collaboration template adopted by the plan
                        * All (known) organizations registered in the plan only
                        * All (known) organizations registered in all plans hosted by the Channels service

                        An organization lists the positions that are relevant to the collaboration and to which it has given roles of responsibility.

                    <description>The collaboration template upon which a collaboration plan is based identifies all the
                        organizations that are involved in the collaboration it defines. Because each collaboration plan
                        may involve its own, local organizations, template developers will often keep the identity of
                        organizations ''to be determined'' by making them ''placeholder'' organizations.

                        A placeholder organization from a collaboration template, for example "The Municipal Police Department",
                        can be associated to one or more organizations known to a collaboration plan, for example, "Gotham Police Department".

                        A collaboration template may identify one of the positions in organizations it defines as
                        a ''custodian'' for a placeholder organization. If so, any user participating in a plan in this
                        position is authorized to associate an organization known to the plan with the template' placeholder
                        organization, in effect, involving the known organization in the collaboration defined for the placeholder
                        organization by the template.

                        Note that a planner acts as the default custodian for all placeholder organizations.

                <item>
                    <description>A position in an organization can be filled one individual and, sometimes, by or more functionally indistinguishable
                        individuals.

                        A position in an organization usually translates to a job title (e.g. Senior VP Sales) and one
                        or more roles and responsibilities (a.k.a. jobs) on the basis of which task checklists are assigned.

                        It is possible that by holding a (primary) position in an organization, a user will automatically
                        be assigned to ''linked'' positions in other organizations.

                        For example, a "Chief of Police" at some municipal police department (primary position) could,
                        according to a template, be automatically assigned to a position of "Member" of the county's
                        "Emergency Operations Center" (linked position). Thus a Chief of Police would have not only the jobs of a chief of police
                        but also all the jobs of a member of the county's emergency operations center.

                        Users participate in a collaboration plan by being assigned to one or more positions.

                        How many and which users can be assigned to a given position (and by who) depends on how
                        the position was defined by the developers of the template.

                        Some positions allow unrestricted self-assignment by users, others require confirmation by supervisors or planners,
                        yet others require some prior, confirmed employment. A position might allow only one user being assigned to it, another might allow any number.

                        The checklists collaboration checklists a user gets depends on the (accepted and confirmed) positions the user has.
                        The checklists are personalized with the contact names and information of other users participating
                        in positions this user will collaborate with according to the plan.

                    A user is the custodian of a placeholder organization if he or she is a planner or is assigned to
                    a position that is identified as the custodian by the developers of the template where the placeholder organization is defined.

                    <description>Organizations and users participate in a collaboration plan.

                        A known organization defined in the collaboration template upon which the collaboration plan is
                        based automatically participates (as itself) in the plan.

                        When an organization is registered in a plan, it does not yet participate in the collaboration
                        defined by the template on which the plan is based. Participation by an organization registered
                        in a plan happens when the organization is associated with a placeholder in the template.

                        When a registered organization is associated with a placeholder organization in the template,
                        the registered organization gets a ''copy'' of all the positions in the placeholder organization.

                        For example, when "Gotham Police Department" in the plan is associated with "Municipal Police department"
                        in the template, the position of "Chief at Gotham Police Department" is created as a copy of the
                        template-defined position of "Chief of Municipal Police Department".

                        Users participate in a plan by assigning themselves or by being assigned to one or more positions
                        in participating organizations.

                        When assigned to a position in an organization by someone else, a user must accept the assignment
                        before it becomes active. Assignment to a position may require confirmation by all users participating
                        in supervisory positions.

                    <description>Each task in a collaboration has an associated checklist that details how to execute the task.
                        The checklist is defined in the collaboration template of the plan based on the nature of the task,
                        its context and impacts and the communications in and out of the task.

                        When a user receives checklists from being assigned to positions assigned to tasks, the checklists
                        are personalized with contact names and information of other users who participate in positions the user collaborates with.

                    A checklist is defined by the nature of the task, what triggers it and by the steps by which the task is best executed.

                        The triggers can be

                        * nothing (if the task is ongoing),
                        * information self-acquired (observation of an event, for example),
                        * information to be researched to carry out another task also assigned to the user,
                        * information sent by another user (a notification)
                        * or information requested by another user (a query).

                        The steps of a checklist can be communications (queries, notifications) or actions (other than communications) taken in executing the task.

                        A step can be required or optional. It might also depend on another having been completed and on some other conditions being present or absent, such as an information need being satisfied or the task having failed. A step can produce outcomes such as events or new information becoming shareable.

                        Keep in mind that the checklist is only a document; it is not an interactive to-do list (at least, not yet).

                    <description>A planning scenario describes anticipated circumstances that would introduce risks an opportunities to organizations who must then collaborate to mitigate those risks and/or seize those opportunities.

                        A planning scenario is defined as an event of significance (a change that matters somewhere in the world) that might happen, or is happening or has happened, possibly in the context of other event that are happening or have happened.

                        A collaboration plan might address more than one, presumably related, planning scenarios.

                    <description>A collaboration requirement specifies expected communication between two organizations in a plan.

                        The requirement specifies in more or less generic terms:
                        * the ''source'' and ''sink'' organizations,
                        * the information to be communicated
                        * the planning scenario in which this communication is to happen
                        * the number of positions in each organization sending and receiving the information
                        * the number of alternate source-positions for each sink-positions

                        A collaboration requirement may or may not apply to a pair of organizations in the plan. If it does then, whether or not it can be realized according to the template-defined collaboration is examined and reported.

                    <description>
                        Business processes (aka workflows) and collaborations are very different concepts, and a collaboration
                        is not necessarily a business process. In fact, bona fide business processes represent the
                        exception rather than the rule.

                        A ''business process'' is a close orchestration of people and systems within an (extended) organization,
                        all working harmoniously according to a known and repeatable script in order to accomplish a common goal.

                        A ''collaboration'', as understood in Channels, is the coordination of interdependent work done
                        by multiple individuals, from one or more organizations, each trying to achieve their own, possibly conflicting,
                        goals.

                        The goals of organizations, namely risk mitigation and opportunity captures, are
                        instantiated by events to be caused, prevented, responded to, recovered from etc.
                        These events, it is assumed, affect, in some ways or other, all the participants in the collaboration,
                        driving them to collaborate and share information.

                        Collaboration planning focuses on information as the source of task inter-dependencies.
                        Information dependencies are satisfied by communications that either coordinate (start, stop) tasks
                        or inform them so they can succeed.

                        Unlike business processes, a collaboration plan does not necessarily script the tasks; it only attempts to resolve their
                        information and coordination inter-dependencies via information flows.
                        The collaboration plan assumes that tasks and communications can fail,
                        which is why Channels encourages information flow redundancies in collaboration plans.

                        Most endeavors involving multiple organizations (each bringing its own agenda) can '''not''' be represented
                        realistically or usefully as business processes. However, most and possibly all multi-organization
                        endeavors can be represented, analyzed and improved upon as collaborations.

                        It is easy to understand the allure of seeing the work of organizations primarily as business processes.
                        If only we always knew exactly how to work together and always did it predictably and in complete harmony!
                        However, the reality is that only a small percentage of all the work we do with others can be
                        represented as business processes.

                        So, this is why most of the efficiencies to be gained from planning how we work together will
                        come from improving the flow of information in collaborations, not in business processes.

                        You can:
                        * create a new collaboration plan by first selecting the production version of a collaboration template on which the plan is to be based, and then pressing the "Start it" button - you will be the founding planner for this plan,
                        * access a collaboration plan visible to you (select the Go button next to its name in the list of plans).

                    <description>As a user you can see and all collaboration plans in which you are a planner or that have been opened for
                        participation by their planners.

                        As a user, you can decide to participate in positions (roughly, organizational roles) that are open to participation by all.

                        If you created the collaboration plan, you are the initial collaboration planner for this plan.
                        As such, you can authorize other users as planners and, if you wish and are not the only one, resign your planner privileges.

                        As a planner, you can name the plan, localize it, update it to a new version of the collaboration template, and set collaboration requirements for it.

                        As a planner, you are automatically a guest of the adopted collaboration template. If you are a guest or a developer of the collaboration template upon which the plan is based, you can access it.

                        As a planner, you can register organizations for potential participation into the plan (or in
                        all plans), in addition to the known organizations defined by the plan's template (they automatically participate). You can also
                        assign users to positions known to the plan.

                        If, as a participant, you are assigned to a position where you supervise other positions, you can assign
                        users to these positions, subject to some constraints, and subject to they accepting the
                        assignment. You are also responsible for confirming these assignments in order to activate them.

                        As a participant, you can access your collaboration checklists, the surveys you take part in,
                        and the replies to feedback you have provided.

                    If you do, then you can assign yourself or be assigned to positions in organizations participating in the plan.

                    Assignments to positions will be subject to you accepting and, where appropriate, to being confirmed by supervisors.

                    Once you participate in a plan, you can withdraw from participation, but only if you are not a planner
                    and if you have not accepted any position. </description>

                        information sharing requirements between organizations participating in the plan.

                        You can then examine to what extent each requirement can be satisfied by the applicable pairs of
                        organizations (information source-sink pairs), should they follow the adopted collaboration template.

                        You can add a new requirement definition by pressing the New button in the Definitions tab.

                        To edit a requirement definition, press on the Edit button next to it in the list of
                        requirements.

                        If you are a planner, you can see the personalized checklists of all users and the generic checklists for all positions.

                        If you participate in a supervisory position, you can see the personalized checklists of all users participating in positions you supervise.

                        By clicking on a position, you access the checklists for those in that position. By clicking on a
                        participant's name, you access the combined checklists for all the positions assigned to the
                        participant in the plan.

                        Note that for a user who participates in only one position, this page is skipped and the user will be taken directly to the Participant Checklist page.

                        A collaboration templates forms the basis of collaboration plans where the identities of ''placeholder'
                        organizations are given and where users are assigned to the positions defined in the templates in terms of
                        jobs given to agents in organizations.

                        A collaboration template specifies how various kinds of organizations ought to communicate and share
                        information to collaboratively prevent, respond to, or recover from a number of anticipated
                        events that test their missions.

                        Channels continuously examines collaboration templates for gaps and brittleness, and suggests
                        options for remediation.

                        Channels produces visualizations, analytics and reports that help planners and stakeholders
                        understand and improve complex collaboration templates.

                        Channels is a ''planning'' tool. It does not manage the ''actual'' sharing of information. It is
                        used to capture and improve the collaboration ''practices'' of organizations and to adaptively
                        produce collaboration checklists.

                    <description>Channels computes personalized collaboration checklists from a collaboration template
                        and provides them to the plan participants on demand.

                        As a user's participation in a plan changes, even as events unfold, Channels automatically
                        adapts and updates the user's checklists.

                <item>
                    <description>A collaboration template is defined by
                        * the planning scenarios that will cause organizations to collaborate and share information
                        * the organizations and agents (stand-ins for people or systems) employed by them that involved in the collaborations
                        * assignable tasks, connected by information flows, that achieve organizational goals in planning scenarios

                        Applying a scope to a collaboration template produces visualizations, analytics, diagnostics,
                        reports and, crucially, collaboration checklists.

                        A collaboration template has one editable development version, zero or one production version
                        (read-only) and any number of retired versions (also read-only).

                        The development version is released by an administrator. Upon releasing a new version of the
                        template, a copy of the development version becomes the new production version and the prior
                        production version is retired. Finally, the development version number is incrementd by one.

                    <description>An event is an entity representing a transient change in the world that introduces
                        risks and/or opportunities for organizations.

                        Risks and events should not be confused. An event can introduce risks to one organization while
                        creating opportunities for another.

                        From the point of view of the template, an event is considered an ''incident'' if its occurrence
                        is not planned (an 'outside' event).

                        A collaboration template can address what happens before, during or after of events, or a
                        combination thereof.

                    <description>The term ''planning scenario'' is used in collaboration planning to mean a phase of an
                        event being planned for, possibly occurring in the context of other past or current events.

                <item>
                    <description>In Channels, a goal is understood as a ''mission-level'' goal of one or more of the
                        organizations to be involved in the template. A goal is either a risk to be mitigated or an
                        opportunity to be seized due to the onset or conclusion of an event.

                        Goals are achieved by successfully carrying out tasks, or they are automatically achieved when
                        an event terminates.

                        Mission-level goals are not to be confused with the implied and unstated goals of successfully
                        executing a task or sharing information.

                    <description>Collaboration templates are composed of one or more or more segments. Each segment
                        addresses a list of organizational goals in one planning scenario.

                        No two segments should address identical goals in identical planning scenarios.

                        Two segments are connected by the flows that span them and by how a task in one segment can
                        start or end an events, thus initiating the other segment.

                        Each element of information has a name, can be accompanied by handling instructions and be given
                        a secrecy classification.

                        as reference, picture or policy.

                    <description>An information product is an entity representing a standard bundle of elements of
                        information.

                        An information product be defined as an extension of another information product to which it
                        adds elements of information.

                        It is recommended that info needs, capabilities and flows be defined in terms of information
                        products.

                        group of persons or systems.

                        An agent can be employed by one or more organizations in titled positions, each specified by a
                        role.

                        Agent ''types'' are not to be confused with ''roles''. Agent types are used to categorize agents
                        independently of their roles. Examples of agent types are "adult", "trained in CPR", "licensed
                        diver" etc.

                    <description>An entity is a grab bag term for "timeless things and concepts". Entities include
                        * agents
                        * events
                        * information formats
                        * information products
                        * organizations
                        * phases
                        * places
                        * roles
                        * transmission media

                        Channels distinguishes between "actual" entities and "types" (or categories) of entities. For
                        example, IBM is an organization whereas "Corporation" is a type of organization.

                        Entities are automatically created when they are first named in the definition of some template
                        element. No two entities of the same kind can have the same name in a template.

                        Entities can be categorized by entity types of the same kind (IBM - an actual organization - is
                        a Corporation -a type of organization - but it can not be a Manager - a role).

                        Categorized entity types form taxonomies (a Police Chief is a Manager is an Employee).

                        Events, information formats, information products, phases, roles and transmission media are
                        always types in Channels.

                    <description>Sharing information can impact the execution of tasks in different ways. It can

                        * terminate the task
                        * be critical (crucial) to the task's success
                        * be useful

                        task's success are considered.

                    <description>Template developers can define surveys for various kinds of template elements (surveys about
                        tasks, about events, about the collaboration template as a whole etc.).

                        A survey is a questionnaire composed of required and optional questions. Questions can have
                        single or multiple answers and they may allow free commentary.

                        A survey is applied to one or more template elements of the appropriate kind (a task survey can
                        be applied to many tasks) and is then sent to one or more users with an optional deadline.

                        Recipients of surveys can accept and answer the survey and revise their answers at any time.
                        Recipients can decline a survey or forward it to their contacts, who are then automatically
                        registered as Channels users.

                    <description>A tag is a word or phrase used to tag template elements in order to informally classify
                        them.

                        Tags can belong to tag domains. For example, ''esf:transportation'' is the tag
                        ''transportation'' in the tag domain ''esf''.

                        Tag domains can optionally be predefined by attaching specially formatted text ''tag'' text
                        files to the template.

                        A given tag can be applied without constraints to template elements of different kinds.

                        One use of tags is to specify information in collaboration requirements.

                    <description>A collaboration checklist lists the steps required to successfully execute a task.

                        A step can be either

                        * some stated activity (other than communicating)
                        * an information request to make,
                        * a notification to send,
                        * sending confirmation of information received,
                        * a self-assigned research sub-task
                        * a self-assigned follow up sub-task

                        A step may be required or optional. A step may have identify the completion of other steps as
                        pre-requisites.

                        A step, to be executable, may also require that some stated conditions (an event phase, a goal
                        having been achieved, an information need having been satisfied, the task having failed) be
                        present or absent.

                        Channels will raise an issue whenever a condition or outcome from the definition of a task is
                        not referenced by at least one step, for example, when a goal achieved by the task is not
                        associated with a step in its checklist.

                        The communication steps of a checklist are implied by the flows in and out of a task, to and
                        from other agents(requested info to be received and notifications to be sent).

                        The sub-task steps are implied by flows to self - research sub-tasks are triggering requests to
                        self and followup sub-tasks are triggering notifications to self.

                        The conditions on executing steps can be the goals achieved and events triggered by the task, or
                        other stated conditions.

                        The outcomes of a task (events caused or terminated, goals achieved, sharing capabilities
                        acquired) can be associated with the execution of individual steps.

                        Functions are "entities" and so they can be categorized by other functions. Functions are always
                        entity "types"; there is no such thing as an "actual" function.

                        A task may or may not declare that it implements a function. If it does, it is expected to
                        conform to the specifications of the function. Issues are raised if the task does not fully do
                        so.

                        You can switch to another template - or another version of this template - by mousing over the
                        name of the template in the "breadcrumbs" at the top of the page. A drop-down menu of templates
                        will appear. If this page was accessed from a collaboration plan, only the versions of the
                        plan-adopted collaboration template are accessible.

                    <description>As a template developer, you use the template editor to

                        * define the scope of the template in terms of risk/opportunity-causing events and of the organizations involved,
                        * compose the template from segments, each one addressing one phase (before, during, after) of one event, and some of the attendant risks/opportunities
                        * define for each segment the information sharing and tasks required to deal with these risks and opportunities
                        * profile the "entities" (events, phases, organizations, roles etc.) referenced in the collaboration template
                        * report issues in addition to those automatically detected by Channels
                        * view analytics to better understand the consequences, strengths and weaknesses of the template

                    <description>The scope of the collaboration template is determined in part by the planning scenarios
                        it addresses. A planning scenario is defined in terms of the phase (before, during or after) of
                        an event and by the event itself. For examples, planning scenarios could be responding during an
                        earthquake (the event), or recovering after an earthquake.

                        The list of all events and phases within the scope of a template thus determines what planning
                        scenarios are within the scope of the collaboration template.

                        The ''All events and phases'' panel allows you to see all events and phases referenced the
                        template and to directly add new ones, as well as delete any not yet referenced.

                        The ''Events'' tab gives access to the list of all events in scope. A new event event can be
                        added by naming it. Since the event is not referenced anywhere else (yet) in the template, it is
                        considered an ''incident'', that is, an external event not caused by a planned task. Its
                        ''incident'' status can only be changed once there is a task that causes it. Events referenced
                        in the plan, other than in this panel,can not be removed from the list.

                        The ''Phases'' tab gives access to the list of all event phases in scope. A new phase can be
                        added by naming it. A phase not yet referenced anywhere else in the template can be deleted.

                    <description>All segments in the template are grouped either by event or by phase. They are
                        connected by cross-segment flows and by causation links.

                        A cross-segment flow is a flow from a task in one segment to a task in another. A causation link
                        is an event caused or terminated by a task in one segment that sets the conditions for another
                        segment.

                        You can drill down on the cross-segment flows and on the causation links.

                        A task is brought into focus for editing by clicking on it in the flow map. Flows can also be
                        opened for editing by clicking on them in the flow map.

                    <description>An information sharing flow connect a tasks that ''produces'' information with a tasks
                        that ''consumes'' it. It is equivalent to connecting an info capability of a task with the info
                        need of another.

                        A sharing flow is created by connecting an info need or a capability to a task. The flow appears
                        in the ''Receives'' of the consuming task and in the ''Sends'' of the producing task.

                        Tasks in different segments can only be connected via their respective, defined info need and
                        info capability.

                <item>
                    <description>A checklist comes pre-populated with steps representing the requested information to be
                        received, the notifications to be sent, the research and follow-up sub-tasks that are defined
                        for the task as flows.

                        These communication steps can not be removed from the checklist. Action steps, representing
                        simple activities requiring no communication or new information, can be added and removed.

                        A step can be given:
                        * Prerequisite steps - steps the step must come "after"
                        * Conditions that must be present for the step to be taken ("if")
                        * Conditions that must be absent for the step to be taken ("unless")
                        * Outcomes from the execution of a step

                        Action steps (not communication steps) can be marked as "required", else they are optional.
                        Communication and sub-task steps are marked as required if they are notifications or follow-ups.

                        Conditions applicable on steps are either:
                        * Goals achieved by the task
                        * Events triggered or terminated by the task
                        * Information needs of the task
                        * The task having failed (a non-optional condition for "on-failure notification steps)
                        * Conditions ''local'' to the execution of the task added to the checklist - they can also be removed

                        Outcomes of a steps can be:
                        * Goals, if any, achieved by the task
                        * Events, if any, caused or terminated by the task
                        * Sharing capabilities acquired for or from successfully executing the task

                        A checklist must be confirmed to be deployed to participants as such. Any change to the implied
                        communication steps or to the action steps requires a re-confirmation.

                        A process flow describing the execution of the checklist is accessed by clicking on the flow
                        icon next to the name of the task.

                    <description>The checklist flow diagram depicts how the steps in the checklist are to be executed.

                        The green dot represents start of execution and the red dot its end. Execution is from left to
                        right.

                        Steps that can be executed in parallel are depicted in parallel. Steps that must precede one
                        another are depicted in sequences.

                        Steps that are executed conditionally are preceded by ''if'' and/or ''unless'' conditions. If
                        there is more than one condition constraining a step, the conditions precede the step in a
                        sequence.

                        The outcomes of steps are shown linked to the steps.

                        One or more known organizations in a collaboration plan can participate as the planned placeholder
                        organization. The participating organization inherits (a copy of) the agents employed by the
                        placeholder.

                        organizations as the placeholder. Whoever in a plan participates as this agent is an acting
                        custodian. Collaboration planners are by default acting custodians.

                        collaboration template the plan has adopted.

                        Depending on the participation constrains set for the agent,
                        * any number of users can participate as the agent
                        * or exactly one user can participate
                        * or at most a specified number of users can participate

                        Furthermore, who can participate as the agent can be set to
                        * any user whatsoever (open participation)
                        * or users confirmed in their participation by other users participating as the agent's supervisors
                        * or users already participating as agents employed by one of the agent's organizations

                        Participation can be anonymous, in which case the names and contact information of participating
                        users will not appear in the checklists of other users.

                    <description>Define a function that tasks can implement.

                        A function can be:
                        * named
                        * described
                        * categorized by other (more generic) functions

                        A function defines the kinds of goals, if any, a task implementing it is expected to achieve, as
                        well as the information needs and information capabilities that such a task is expected to have
                        in order to conform to the function.

                        The goals specified by a function are goal categories plus whether they are risks to be
                        mitigated or gaines to be made.

                        The information needs and capabilities specified by the function are named, optionally point to
                        an information product, and define function-specific elements of information.

                        When a function is categorized by other functions, it adds to the goals, information needs and
                        capabilitites that the categorizing functions define.

                    <description>A collaboration template determines how agents must commit to share information with
                        one another.

                        Commitment networks depict these communication commitment relationships between agents either
                        directly or aggregated by role or organization.

                        You can drill down on each commitment relationship to see the communicationg commitments it
                        summarizes.

                        All issues about the template element are listed. The developer-reported issues can be opened up
                        to edit their names, description, severity and remediation options. When editing remediation
                        options, start each one on a new line.

                        Some issues detected by Channels can be waived (marked as false positives).

                        You can report a new issue by pressing the New button and then editing the issue. When
                        describing remediation options, start each one on a new line.

                        You can automatically create a survey about remediating an issue by pressing on the ''Create

                    <description>Collaboration checklists are computed by assigning agents to tasks and by deriving
                        communication commitments from the flows connecting assigned tasks.

                        A key concern is making sure that the right agents get assigned to the right tasks, and that
                        only the right agents that are assigned to the tasks on each side of a flow become parties to
                        communication commitments.

                        Which agents are assigned to a task is determined by
                        * how a task specifies the agents assignable to it
                        * what agents are in the template's environments and how they are profiled
                        * how the agents are employed (role, jurisdiction, organization)

                    <description>Entities (i.e. roles, agents, organizations, places, events etc.) can be categorized.
                        Agents are categorized by agent types, organization by organization types, events by other
                        events (events are always types) etc.

                        How entities are categorized largely determine the meaning of the tasks, flows, employments etc.
                        that are defined in terms of these entities.

                        The meaning of a template boils down to the task assignments and consequent communication commitments
                        (checklists) that are implied by the collaboration template.

                        Even a small change to the taxonomy (a.k.a. typology) or roles, for example, can cause
                        widespread changes to the checklists computed from a template, and thus its meaning.

                        Taxonomies are defined implicitly by categorizing individual entities. The best way to verify
                        that taxonomies are correct is to visualize them.

                    <description>A ''flow map'' shows tasks connected by flows where each flow can imply a potentially
                        large number of communication commitments. The ''checklists map'' makes it easy to see if the sharing
                        commitments generated from the template are the intended ones.

                        The map is focused on one agent or one organization (as an aggregate of agents). It shows the
                        commitments that involved that egent or organizations.

                        The other parties to the commitments can be aggregated by role, organization type or not at all.

                    <description>You can enlist the help of stakeholders via surveys. A survey is a questionnaire about
                        elements of the template or the template as a whole.

                        You compose questionnaires by adding, ordering, editing etc. statements and questions. Questions
                        can be marked as required or optional.

                        A questionnaire applies to the template as a whole or to one kind of template element (template
                        questionnaire, task questionnaires, event questionnaires etc.)

                        Questionnaires can be activated and deactivated. They can be extended while they are being used
                        in surveys.

                        automatically generated based on the remediation options.

                        An issue remediation survey is automatically deactivated when the issue disappears.

                        Note that the issue remediation questionnaires are by default not shown in the list of all
                        questionnaires; a checkbox must be checked to see them.

                        given a deadline to answer all of the survey's required questions.

                        automatically given a login, password and limited access to the template as a participant.

                    <description>The entity types used to categorize roles, agents, organizations, places, events etc.
                        (entities) can themselves be categorized to create taxonomies.

                        Changes to a taxonomy can have profound impacts on the collaboration checklists that are
                        generated by the template.

                        Taxonomies can be visualized to verify that they are correct.

                <name>Cross-referencing template elements</name>
                <item>
                    <description>Whenever a template element is referenced by name in the definition of another, there
                        will also be a link to get to the referenced element's definition.

                        Also, most forms used to define an element of the template contain a table listing and linking
                        to all other elements that reference it in their definitions.

                        For example, at the bottom of in the profile of a role is an index of all other template
                        elements that reference the role or that match the role.

                    <description>As an administrator, you manage templates and users for a Channels server.

                        Template management consists of:

                        * Creating a new template with a unique resource identifier (URI)
                        * Deleting a template - permitted only if not yet adopted by a collaboration plan
                        * Putting the current development version of a template into production
                        * Naming the owner of the template
                        * Changing the default email addresses at which user or developer feedback is sent

                        User management consists of:

                        * Adding a new user with a unique username - be aware that users can not be deleted, only disabled
                        * Giving a user a full name, email address and password - the user can later modify all of these
                        * Making the user as an admin
                        * Disabling the user - this can be later reversed
                        * Giving the user developer vs guest (view-only) status for specific collaboration templates.
