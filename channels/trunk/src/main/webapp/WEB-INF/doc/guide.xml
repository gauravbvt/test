            <name>About Channels</name>
            <step>
                <description>Planners use Channels to capture how organizations share or ought to share information to jointly and successfully prevent, respond to, or recover from events that test their missions.

Channels continuously examines these ''information sharing plans'' for gaps and brittleness, and suggests options for remediation.

Channels produces visualizations, analytics and reports that help planners and stakeholders understand and improve complex plans. 

Channels computes the personalized information sharing protocols implied in a plan and serves them to its participants.

            <step>
                <description>A plan is the combination of
# a model of how information is to be acquired and shared so that tasks that achieve organizational goals can be successfully carried out
# an environment that identifies the plan's participants, namely, people and systems in roles of responsibility within organizations
A model is applied to an environment to produce visualizations, analytics, diagnostics, reports and information sharing protocols.

            <step>
                <description>An event is a transient change in the world that introduces risks and/or opportunities. 

Risks and events should not be confused; an event can introduce risks to one organization while creating opportunities for another. 

From the point of view of the plan, an event is an ''incident'' if its occurrence is not caused by the execution of a task in the plan (an 'outside' event).</description>

            <step>
                <description>A phase is a named time period relative to the occurrence of events. A phase is either the time before, during or after events.

A plan can elect to address only the before, during or after of events, or a combination thereof.

An element of information also has a name and may be accompanied by handling instructions and with a secrecy classification.

                <description>Information sharing protocols (aka procedures or guidelines) are computed by assigning agents to tasks and by deriving information sharing commitments from the flows connecting assigned tasks.
                    
A key concern is making sure that the right agents get assigned to the right tasks, and that only the right agents that are assigned to the tasks on each side of a flow become parties to sharing commitments.
                
Which agents are assigned to a task is determined by
* how a task specifies the agents assignable to it
* what agents are in the plan's environments and how they are profiled
* how the agents are employed (role, jurisdiction, organization)
* how the taxonomies of role, agent, organization etc. are defined

                <description> Roles, agents, organizations, places, events etc. (entities) can be categorized.
Agents are categorized by agent types, organization by organization types, events by other events (events are always types) etc.

How entities are categorized largely determine the meaning of the tasks, flows, employments etc. that are defined in terms of these entities.

The meaning of a plan boils down to the task assignments and consequent sharing commitments (protocols) that are implied by the plan. 
Even a small change to the taxonomy (a.k.a. typology) or roles, for example, can cause widespread changes to the protocols computed from a plan and thus its meaning.
                
Taxonomies are defined implictly by categorizing individual entities. Taxonomies can be visualized to verify that they are correct.

                <description>The ''flow map'', which is central to the plan editor, shows tasks connected by flows where each flow can imply a potentially large number of sharing commitments.

The ''assignments and commitments map'' makes it easy to see if the sharing commitments generated from the plan are the intended ones.
                
The map is focused on one agent or one organization (as an aggregate of agents). It shows the commitments that involved that egent or organizations.

The other parties to the commitments can be aggregated by role, organization type or not at all.

                <description>Planners can enlist the help of stakeholders via surveys. A survey is a questionnaire about elements of the plan or the plan as a whole.

Planners compose questionnaires by adding, ordering, editing etc. statements and questions. Questions can be marked as required or optional.

A questionnaire applies to the plan as a whole or to one kind of plan element (plan questionnaire, task questionnaires, event questionnaires etc.)

Questionnaires can be activated and deactivated. They can be extended while they are being used in surveys.

                <description>Whenever a plan element is referenced by name in the definition of another, there will also be a link to get to the referenced element's definition.
                    
Also, most forms used to define an element of the plan contain a table listing all and linking to all other elements that reference it in their definitions.

For example, at the bottom of in the profile of a role is an index of all other elements that reference the role or that match the role.</description>
