            <name>Designing collaboration plans</name>
            <step>
                <description>Planners use Channels to design collaboration plans from which robust collaboration protocols are generated.
                    
A collaboration plan models how various types of organizations share or ought to share information to collaboratively prevent, respond to, or recover from a number of anticipated events that test their missions.
                    
Channels continuously examines these ''collaboration plans'' for gaps and brittleness, and suggests options for remediation.
                    
Channels produces visualizations, analytics and reports that help planners and stakeholders understand and improve complex collaboration plans.               
                
Channels is a ''planning'' tool.  It does not manage the ''actual'' sharing of information. It is used to capture and improve the collaboration ''practices'' of organizations and to adaptively produce collaboration protocols.

            <step>
                <description>Channels computes personalized collaboration protocols from a collaboration plan and serves them to plan participants on demand.
                    
As a user's participation in a plan changes, even as events unfold, Channels automatically adapts and updates the user's protocols.

                <description>A collaboration plan is the combination of
# a model of how information is to be acquired and shared so that tasks that achieve organizational goals can be successfully carried out
# an environment that identifies the plan's participants, namely, people and systems in roles of responsibility within organizations
Applying an environment to a collaboration plan produces visualizations, analytics, diagnostics, reports and collaboration protocols.

            <step>
                <description>An event is a transient change in the world that introduces risks and/or opportunities for organizations. 

Risks and events should not be confused. An event can introduce risks to one organization while creating opportunities for another. 

From the point of view of the plan, an event is considered an ''incident'' if its occurrence is not planned (an 'outside' event).</description>

                <description>A phase is a named time period relative to the occurrence of events. A phase is either the time before, during or after events.

                <description>Collaboration protocols are computed by assigning agents to tasks and by deriving information sharing commitments from the flows connecting assigned tasks.
                    
A key concern is making sure that the right agents get assigned to the right tasks, and that only the right agents that are assigned to the tasks on each side of a flow become parties to sharing commitments.
                
Which agents are assigned to a task is determined by
* how a task specifies the agents assignable to it
* what agents are in the plan's environments and how they are profiled
* how the agents are employed (role, jurisdiction, organization)
* how the taxonomies of role, agent, organization etc. are defined

                <description> Roles, agents, organizations, places, events etc. (entities) can be categorized.
Agents are categorized by agent types, organization by organization types, events by other events (events are always types) etc.

How entities are categorized largely determine the meaning of the tasks, flows, employments etc. that are defined in terms of these entities.

The meaning of a plan boils down to the task assignments and consequent sharing commitments (protocols) that are implied by the collaboration plan. 
Even a small change to the taxonomy (a.k.a. typology) or roles, for example, can cause widespread changes to the protocols computed from a plan and thus its meaning.
                
Taxonomies are defined implictly by categorizing individual entities. Taxonomies can be visualized to verify that they are correct.

                <description>The ''flow map'', which is central to the plan editor, shows tasks connected by flows where each flow can imply a potentially large number of sharing commitments.

The ''protocols map'' makes it easy to see if the sharing commitments generated from the plan are the intended ones.
                
The map is focused on one agent or one organization (as an aggregate of agents). It shows the commitments that involved that egent or organizations.

The other parties to the commitments can be aggregated by role, organization type or not at all.

                <description>Planners can enlist the help of stakeholders via surveys. A survey is a questionnaire about elements of the plan or the plan as a whole.

Planners compose questionnaires by adding, ordering, editing etc. statements and questions. Questions can be marked as required or optional.

A questionnaire applies to the plan as a whole or to one kind of plan element (plan questionnaire, task questionnaires, event questionnaires etc.)

Questionnaires can be activated and deactivated. They can be extended while they are being used in surveys.

                <description>Surveys can be launched on an issue that was detected. The questionnaire is automatically generated based on the remediation options. 

The questionnaire can be modified and extended while the survey is ongoing. 

An issue remediation survey is automatically deactivated when the issue disappears.

Note that the issue remediation questionnaires are by default not shown in the list of all questionnaires; a checkbox must be checked to see them.

After the deadline has passed, the survey is considered late. Late participants can be ''nagged'' (nags are sent by email).

A participant can
*accept the invitation by answering questions, 
*decline the invitation
*forward the survey to others (if planners marked the survey as forwardable).

Note that anyone who is forwarded a survey and who is not yet a user of Channels is automatically given a login, password and limited access to the plan as a participant.
