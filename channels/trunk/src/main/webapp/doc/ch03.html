      information sharing planning.</p><p>The main activities of this method are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>setting the scope of the Plan,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>dividing the Plan into segments,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>defining tasks and information flows,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>defining referenced entities,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>closing gaps in the Plan,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>addressing other issues,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>deploying the current version to participants.</p></li></ul></div><p>The method here outlined does not address the politics and project
      logistics of information sharing planning.</p><p>When building a new Information Sharing Plan, planners must first
      decide on the scope of the Plan. The scope is set by choosing:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>the anticipated types of events planned for,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the specific phases (before, during or after) to be covered
          for each event,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the organizations and roles which involvement is
          expected.</p></li></ul></div><p>Planners divide the Plan into segments. Each segment covers one
      phase of one event and a small list of risks to organizations. Two
      segments can cover the same event phase, but not the same goal for the
      same phase of the same event.</p><p>A planner works on one segment at a time and can switch attention
      to another segment at any time. When working on a segment, tasks and
      information flows linking tasks are identified and defined so that they
      together address the risks covered by the segment.</p><p>Events, phases, agents, roles, organizations, places, and
      communication media are collectively called entities. Entities are
      referenced by name in the definitions of a plan's scope, a segment's
      coverage, tasks, information flows, and other entities. An entity can be
      referenced by name prior to being defined. An entity should be defined
      soon after having first been referenced.</p><p>The Plan is best grown by progressively closing gaps (completeness
      issues) such as those caused by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>events or goals not addressed,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>unsatisfied task information needs,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>information produced by tasks that is not shared,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>tasks to which no known agents are assigned,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>information flows with no listed communication media.</p></li></ul></div><p>Planners can also be presented with issues other than completeness
      issues, namely, validity and robustness issues. Planners prioritize the
      resolution of issues possibly on the basis of their severity. Some types
      of issues can be waived if deemed &#8220;false positives&#8221;. When tackling an
      issue, planners may choose to first survey their peers and participants
      involved in the Plan about alternate remediation strategies.</p><p>The planning process is iterative and non-linear. At any point in
      time, planners can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>change the scope of a Plan,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>add/modify/remove new Plan segments,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>add/modify/remove tasks and flows in a segment,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>resolve issues,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>(re)define referenced entities.</p></li></ul></div><p>At any point during the development of a Plan, planners may decide
      to deploy the current version to participants. If a previous version had
      already been deployed, it is immediately retired and superseded by the
      new one. Keep in mind that a Plan is never complete and planning is
      never done.</p><div class="section" title="Deciding on the scope of the Plan"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1135"></a>Deciding on the scope of the Plan</h3></div></div></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>What anticipated events are being being planned for?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>For each anticipated event:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="circle"><li class="listitem"><p>What type of event is it?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At what place or type of place would the event
