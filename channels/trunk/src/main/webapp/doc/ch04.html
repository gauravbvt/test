      Management</h2></div></div></div><p>The most frequently asked question about Information Sharing
      Planning is How does it differ from Business Process Management?</p><p>To answer this question, one must first consider that Information
      Sharing Planning (ISP) is part of something larger called Information
      Sharing Management.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Information Sharing Management</em></span> (ISM) is a set
      of technologies and best practices that help communities of
      organizations share information more effectively in order to manage
      risks when preparing for, responding to, and recovering from actual
      events. Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces the information
      sharing procedures that organizations apply when doing ISM. ISP analyzes
      these procedures for continuous improvement.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Business Process Management</em></span> (BPM) helps
      enterprises become more efficient, more effective and more agile in how
      they operate. Business Process Modeling captures and analyzes their
      business processes for continuous improvement.</p><p>Because ISP relates most closely to Business Process Modeling, the
      question should be recast to How does Information Sharing Management
      differ from Business Process Management?</p><p>Other questions are Can ISM and BPM be used together?, and How do
      the markets for BPM and ISM compare?</p><div class="section" title="Differences"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1556"></a>Differences</h3></div></div></div><p>BPM and ISM tackle different problems from different
        perspectives.</p><p>BPM focuses 'inward' on a single (but possibly extended)
        enterprise. It looks at how the enterprise responds internally to
        events, and at how it renders services to its customers. The end is
        maximizing value creation while minimizing costs. The means is
        business process improvement.</p><p>ISM focuses 'outward' on (often ad hoc) communities of
        organizations. It looks at how organizations depend on one another to
        get the information they need to execute tasks that achieve
        organizational goals. The end is minimizing the impacts of systemic
        risks and maximizing the capture of opportunities. The means is better
        information sharing procedures.</p><p>While there is conceptual overlap (both ISM and BPM involve
        tasks, events and communications) and even though they both use
        somewhat similar-looking visualizations (directed graphs), ISM and BPM
        have very different world views. BPM looks at the operations of an
        enterprise, whereas ISM looks at the information flows within a
        community of organizations. They also differ in their goals. BPM
        optimizes enterprise value creation whereas ISM reduces the impacts of
        systemic risks.</p></div><div class="section" title="Similarities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1567"></a>Similarities</h3></div></div></div><p>ISM and BPM are structurally similar in a number of ways.</p><p>Both BPM and ISM are concerned with optimization. BPM optimizes
        the design and execution of business processes, whereas ISM optimizes
        information sharing procedures and their application.</p><p>BPM and ISM each has a modeling component (business process
        modeling, information sharing planning) and a deployment component
        (modeled business processed are deployed as work flows, information
        sharing plans are deployed as information sharing procedures).</p><p>Both BPM and ISM integrate with existing systems and
        technologies. BPM integrates with EAI (Enterprise Application
        Integration), SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and EBA (Event-Based
        Architecture) technologies. ISM integrates primarily with
        Communication Technologies, Enterprise Directories and SOA.</p><p>Finally, both BPM and ISM require the participation of analysts.
        BPM involves 'business process engineers' and ISM involves
        'information sharing planners'.</p></div><div class="section" title="Integration"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1580"></a>Integration</h3></div></div></div><p>Because BPM and ISM have such different world views, we should
        not expect either to eventually absorb the other.</p><p>There are however significant points of interaction between BPM
        and ISM. To name a few, business processes can be driven by events
        that become known through information sharing, and the business
        processes executed when carrying out risk-mitigating tasks can be
        optimized.</p><p>It is reasonable to assume that BPM and ISM products will, in
        some future, work together to their mutual benefit.</p></div><div class="section" title="Markets"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e1589"></a>Markets</h3></div></div></div><p>&#8220;The BPM market is one of the fastest growing software markets,
        estimated to grow tenfold in five years, from approximately US$500
        million in 2006 to US$6 billion in 2011.&#8221; <sup>[<a name="d0e1594" href="#ftn.d0e1594" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup></p><p>While BPM is a maturing field, ISM is still in its infancy. It
        is too early to attempt an estimate of how fast the market for ISM
        could grow or how big it could ultimately become.</p><p>However, ISM is applicable to all domains of joint human
        endeavor, from emergency response to business risk management. With
        the explosive growth in systemic risks, as underscored by the recent
        financial crisis, the value proposition of ISM in an increasingly
        inter-connected world is bound to become compelling.</p><p>As BPM products become consolidated among a small number of
        large vendors, ISM may represent a unique opportunity for small firms
        to enter and define a new market space. Established BPM vendors might
        also want to offer BPMintegrated ISM products in order to
        differentiate themselves from their competitors.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a name="ftn.d0e1594" href="#d0e1594" class="para">1</a>] </sup>See
