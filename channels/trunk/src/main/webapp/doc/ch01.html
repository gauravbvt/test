    inter-dependent world. Systemic risks are growing. Organizations must
    network to compete in a global marketplace. They can no longer respond to
    major crisis nor can they seize global business opportunities on their
    own. Success now largely depends on the timely and targeted sharing of
    information within and between organizations.</p><p>During a crisis, information will not spontaneously flow as needed.
    Maintaining contact lists is not enough; organizations must plan ahead and
    create actionable information sharing procedures.</p><p>Information Sharing Planning provides a framework and method for
    designing and improving the information sharing procedures required to
    successfully manage systemic risks and seize opportunities.</p><div class="section" title="In a nutshell"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e31"></a>In a nutshell</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Information Sharing Planning captures, analyzes and
      deploys knowledge of how organizations need to share information to
      mitigate systemic risks and seize opportunities from anticipated
      events.</em></span></p><p>Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces information sharing
      procedures for event preparedness, response and recovery. Information
      Sharing Plans capture commitments to share the information required for
      organizations to fulfill their missions.</p><p>ISP uncovers:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>who needs what information, and why and when,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>who has or can produce needed information, and how and
          when,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>what information should flow, and when and how,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the consequences of not sharing according to Plan.</p></li></ul></div><p>The deliverables of ISP are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>documented information sharing procedures</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>individualized information sharing 'playbooks',</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>information flow analytics and visualizations,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>detected information sharing gaps, bottlenecks and single
          points of failure.</p></li></ul></div><p>It is important understand that an Information Sharing Plan is not
      an action plan. Its objective is not to dictate a sequence of actions.
      Information sharing planning concerns itself exclusively with capturing
      the information sharing required according to circumstance so that
      necessary tasks can be carried out successfully.</p><p>However, task sequencing is not entirely absent from ISP. A task
      may require information produced by another task that would then
      necessarily precede it. These sequencing constraints do not typically
      apply to all tasks and they certainly do not dictate a unique ordering
      for all tasks. In any case, attempting to define an action plan for
      organizations that don't have a central authority is more often than not
      an exercise in futility. What really matters here is capturing what
      needs to be done, what information is required and produced, and how and
      when it should or should not be shared.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="channels_user_guide.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center">&nbsp;</td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch01s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Information Sharing Planning with Channels&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Definitions</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
