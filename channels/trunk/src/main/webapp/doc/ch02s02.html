                a login screen.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_50.png"></div></div><p>After logging in, a user with planning privileges (a planner)
                accesses the Plan Editor. A participant is directed to his/her
                playbook (see section 3.15). For a planner, the editor opens on the
                development version of an assigned Plan.
            </p><p>When the Plan Editor is first accessed, Channels pre-selects a
                segment and a task within it. The task with its &#8220;receive&#8221; and &#8220;send&#8221;
                information flows are shown &#8220;collapsed&#8221; and summarized.
            </p><p>A planner can at any time select to see another version of the
                Plan, if any. A planner can also switch to another assigned Plan. Only
                the development version of a Plan can be modified; retired and
                production versions are &#8220;read-only&#8221; (all form fields are disabled, no
                survey can be launched).
            </p><p>A planner can at any time select which segment within a Plan to
                view or work on. The tasks and information flows of the selected
                segment are visualized as a flow map (a directed graph). The selected
                task is highlighted (by a gray rectangle) in the flow map.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1.png"></div></div><p>Flow maps can be quite large. A planner can maximize a flow map
                to see more of it without needing to scroll. Whether maximized or not,
                a flow map can be zoomed out to fit within the available space.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1a.png"></div></div><p>Tasks and flows are drawn in red if they have known issues.
                Green and red traffic lights represent the start and end of the event
                phase covered by the segment. Tasks that are triggered by the start of
                the segment are connected to the green traffic light icon. Tasks that
                terminate the event phase are linked to the red traffic light.
            </p><p>Information flows (information shared), information needs
                (information needed for carrying out a task) and information
                capabilities (shareable information produced by carrying out a task)
                are shown as arrows. Single-headed arrows represent notifications.
                Double-headed arrows are requests, with the empty arrow head pointing
                to the task that consumes the information request, and with the full
                arrow head pointing to the task that consumes the answer (the
                requested information flows to it).
            </p><p>Dots indicate to-be-determined tasks. An arrow from a task to a
                dot represents an information capability of the task (information
                produced by the task that can be shared for use in other tasks). An
                arrow from a dot to a task represents an information need of the task
                (the task needs information possibly produced by other tasks).
            </p><p>Tasks with a blue background denote remote tasks, that is, tasks
                from another segment that are connected by sharing flows to tasks in
                the selected segment.
            </p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2.png"></div></div><p>When a task is selected in a maximized flow map, the flow map is
                automatically de-maximized to show the summaries of the selected task
                and those of its flows.
