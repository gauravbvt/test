        information needed by other tasks. <a class="firstterm" href="ch05.html#information_sharing_flow"><em class="firstterm">Information sharing
        flows</em></a> connect tasks that produce information with tasks
        that consume it. Shared information is communicated over <a class="firstterm" href="ch05.html#transmission_medium"><em class="firstterm">transmission media</em></a> or face
        to face. Sharing can be subject to <a class="firstterm" href="ch05.html#policy"><em class="firstterm">policies</em></a>.</p><p>A task specifies, in more or less generic terms, which agents
        should be assigned to it, individually or as teams. Information
        sharing procedures are generated by matching agents within the scope
        of the Plan to the tasks. Agents are bound by <a class="firstterm" href="ch05.html#information_sharing_commitment"><em class="firstterm">information sharing
        commitments</em></a> whenever they are assigned to tasks that are
        connected by flows to other tasks. These agents commit to share the
        <a class="firstterm" href="ch05.html#information"><em class="firstterm">information</em></a> they produce
        with all agents who execute the connected-to tasks that consume it. An
        implied but important constraint is that information can only be used
        to execute tasks for which it is explicitly shared.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/ISP_metamodel.png"/></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Plan segments"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e147"/>Plan segments</h3></div></div></div><p>Information sharing plans typically deal with more than one
        phase of more that one anticipated event, and they can involve a large
        number of organizations. Because plans can become quite large,
        planners break them into smaller, more manageable units of planning
        called segments.</p><p>An information sharing <em class="glossterm">segment</em> covers
        only one phase of one event and addresses some of the related
        organizational goals. A segment will typically focus on just a few
        goals. Segments usually depend on other segments. Two segments are
        co-dependent when information produced by a task in one segment is
        consumed by a task in the other, or when a task in one segment
        initiates the event phase covered by the other segment.</p></div><div class="section" title="Tasks and flows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e157"/>Tasks and flows</h3></div></div></div><p>A task describes an action carried out at some location and for
        some purpose by one or more agents. Agents act to fulfill the
        responsibilities of roles bestowed on them by organizations. The
        agents expected to carry out a task can be identified by any
        combination of name, role, jurisdiction and organization. The executor
        of a task may be identified only partially (for example, by role and
        organization only) so that more than one person or system will match
        the profile and get assigned to the task. According to a tasks'
        definition, those assigned to the task are expected to carry it out
        either as a team or on their own.</p><p>Tasks are considered useful if they:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>directly achieve risk mitigation or gains,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>initiate or terminate (phases of) events,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>or produce information needed by other useful tasks.</p></li></ul></div><p>Tasks can be triggered or terminated by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>awareness of events,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>notifications they receive,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>requests for information they receive,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>the failure of a task.</p></li></ul></div><p><em class="glossterm">Information flows</em> link tasks that produce
        information to tasks that consume it. A flow is characterized
        by:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>the information communicated (down to its elements, each
            with optional secrecy classifications and optional sourcing and

        sharing flows are defined in terms of agents, places, roles,
        organizations, events, transmission media and phases of events. These
        are called entities. An ISP entity can be unambiguously referenced by
        name in the specifications of tasks and flows, and in the profiles of
        other entities. An entity in ISP is anything that can be named while
        not something an agent does.</p><p>There are actual entities and types of entities. Actual entities
        (“Jane Smith”, “ACME Inc.”, “Morristown, Morris County, NJ, USA” etc.)
        are categorized by types of entities (“Senior executive”,
        “Corporation”, “City” etc.). Entity types can refine other entity
        types (a “Senior executive” is an “Executive”).</p><p>An <em class="glossterm">agent</em> is either a person or an
        information system (system for short). A system is capable of sending
        notifications, answering queries, receiving notifications or sending
        queries. An agent has contact information and availability (24/7 by
        default). An agent's clearance is a list of secrecy classifications. A
        secrecy classification has a name (“NATO”) and an ordered list of
        secrecy levels (“Restricted”, “Confidential”, “Secret”, “Focal Top
        Secret”, “Cosmic Top Secret”). An agent type can be thought of as a
        qualification that can be shared by different agents (e.g. "adult" or
        "registered driver"). An agent type is not to be confused with a role.
        A role implies responsibilities whereas an agent type denotes
        qualifications or status. An agent can be flagged as a system
        (non-human). When a group of agents are indistinguisable from a
        planning perspective (for example, call center operators), they can be
        profiled as a single <em class="glossterm">archetype</em> agent (for
        example, "a call center operator").</p><p>An <em class="glossterm">organization</em> is a group of agents
        organized to accomplish a mission. An organization assigns roles of
        responsibility to the persons and systems that act on its behalf. An
        organization has contact information and may contain other
        organizations. An organization may have information sharing agreements
        with other organizations to formalize the sharing commitments its
        members have with members of other organizations.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">role</em> is a set of powers and
        responsibilities bestowed by an organization to an agent acting on
        behalf of the organization. A role assignment may be restricted to a
        jurisdiction (a place).</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">place</em> is either a geographical area
        (some city, county, state, country, natural preserve etc.) or a known
        location (some train station, building etc.). A place can be contained
        in another (for example, a building can be in a campus). An event and
        an event type can both be scoped to a place.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">phase</em> names a time period relative to
        an event. A phase of an event is either set to before, during or after
        the event. Typical phases are “Preparing”, “Responding” and
        “Recovering”.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">transmission medium</em> is a means by which
        agents transmit information to one another. A medium is either unicast
        (transmits to a single, known agent), multicast (transmits to
        multiple, known agents) or broadcast (little to no control over who
        receives the transmission). Transmission media may or may not be
        technology-based. “Telephone”, “Email”, “Instant Messaging” are
        examples of unicast communication media, and so is “Face-to-face”.
        “Notification system” and “Meeting” are both multicast media.
        “Television”, “Radio” and “PA System” are examples of broadcast media.
        A transmission medium can delegate transmissions to other media (for
        example, VoIP can interface with Telephones). The security of a medium
        is expressed in terms of secrecy classifications.</p></div><div class="section" title="Issues"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e261"/>Issues</h3></div></div></div><p>ISP identifies many different kinds of
        <em class="glossterm">issues</em> (80 and counting) about tasks,
        information flows, entities and entire segments and plans. There are
        issues of validity (definition errors), completeness (something
        obvioudly missing from the Plan) and robustness (something that makes
        the Plan failure-prone). An issue has a description, a list of
        suggested remediations, and a severity level (minor, major, severe,
        extreme). The severity is either a constant or it is calculated from
        the potential cascade of task failures attributable to the
        issue.</p></div><div class="section" title="The meaning of information in ISP"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e269"/>The meaning of information in ISP</h3></div></div></div><p>Tasks and flows are defined in terms of information needed,
        uncovered and shared. The information is named and is broken into
        atomic elements. Each element of information is named, can be given
        security classifications and can be annotated with a description,
        handling instructions and with transformative relationships to other
        elements of information.</p><p>An element of information is considered atomic for the purposes
        of a plan; it is the indivisible unit of transmission and
        transformation.</p><p>The notion of the plurality of an element is left undefined. For
        example, if "suspicious activity report" information contains the
        element "suspect profile" then it is possible that there will be more
        than one suspect profiles in a report.</p><p>When analyzing flows, Channels is not concerned with what the
        information actually means. Rather it cares about whether or not two
        flows share the same information, and whether an element of
        information is the same as, or is the transformation of, another
        element of information.</p><p>If the information in two flows share the same name, does it
        mean that they represent, conceptually, the same information? Not
        necessarily. Two tasks performed respectively by a EOC commander and a
        corporate CEO and both needing a "situation assessment" would likely
        not need that same elements of information (even if the elements
        themselves have identical names).</p><p>In Channels, identically named flows, needs and capabilities
        (ignoring uppercase vs lowercase and extra spaces) are meant to
        represent the same kind of information (they are synonymous)
        <span class="emphasis"><em>only if</em></span> they connect to the same task
        specification. Similarly, identically named elements of information
        represent the same atom of information <span class="emphasis"><em>only if</em></span>
        they compose synonymous information.</p><p>Agents executing a task receive and send information. The
        information they receive and send may have different names an yet have
        common elements of information. For example, the "suspect profile"
        element of a sent "suspicious activity report" information may be the
        same as the "suspect description" element of a received "security
        tip", and it may be the same as the "suspect profile" of received
        "BOLO" information.</p><p>Alternately, an element sent may aggregate elements received.
        Aggregation combines many elements into a single element, with loss of
        data. For example, a "suspects count" element aggregates "suspect
        profile" elements into a single number, losing the details of the
        individual profiles. Counting is only one of many kinds of possible
        aggregations. A "threat level", for example, might aggregate a great
        deal of different elements into a rating.</p><p>In order to track the dissemination of information, it necessary
        to indicate when sent elements are renamed or are aggregated. Channels
        need only differentiate between two kinds of element transformation,
        renaming and aggregation, in order to track the dissemination of
        information. The description field of an element of information can be
        used to provide more details about the specific nature of an
        aggregation.</p><p>Issue detection takes element renaming and aggregation into
        account. For example, while it may be acceptable to declassify
        aggregated elements, it is not acceptable to declassify a renamed,
        classified element.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Benefits and deliverables </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. The ISP Method</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
