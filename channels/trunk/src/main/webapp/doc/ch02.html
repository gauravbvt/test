      analyzing and deploying Information Sharing Plans.</p><p>Each Information Sharing Plan has one development version (the
      only one that can be modified), possibly one production version (the
      only one participants can access to view their playbooks), and zero or
      more retired versions (prior production versions).</p><div class="section" title="User roles"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e225"></a>User roles</h3></div></div></div><p>Channels recognizes three user roles: administrators, planners
        and Plan participants. Administrators assign planners and participants
        to plans hosted by a Channels instance. Planners jointly develop,
        review and deploy information sharing plans. Participants view their
        playbooks and respond to surveys from planners about issue
        resolutions.</p><p>An administrator can:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>add new plans to Channels,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>assign users to plans and change their user roles,</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>do what any planner or participant can do, but for all

        a login screen.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_50.png"></div></div><p>After logging in, a user with planning privileges (a planner)
        accesses the Plan Editor. A participant is directed to his/her
        playbook (see section 3.15). For a planner, the editor opens on the
        development version of an assigned Plan.</p><p>When the Plan Editor is first accessed, Channels pre-selects a
        segment and a task within it. The task with its &#8220;receive&#8221; and &#8220;send&#8221;
        information flows are shown &#8220;collapsed&#8221; and summarized.</p><p>A planner can at any time select to see another version of the
        Plan, if any. A planner can also switch to another assigned Plan. Only
        the development version of a Plan can be modified; retired and
        production versions are &#8220;read-only&#8221; (all form fields are disabled, no
        survey can be launched).</p><p>A planner can at any time select which segment within a Plan to
        view or work on. The tasks and information flows of the selected
        segment are visualized as a flow map (a directed graph). The selected
        task is highlighted (by a gray rectangle) in the flow map.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1.png"></div></div><p>Flow maps can be quite large. A planner can maximize a flow map
        to see more of it without needing to scroll. Whether maximized or not,
        a flow map can be zoomed out to fit within the available space.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_1a.png"></div></div><p>Tasks and flows are drawn in red if they have known issues.
        Green and red traffic lights represent the start and end of the event
        phase covered by the segment. Tasks that are triggered by the start of
        the segment are connected to the green traffic light icon. Tasks that
        terminate the event phase are linked to the red traffic light.</p><p>Information flows (information shared), information needs
        (information needed for carrying out a task) and information
        capabilities (shareable information produced by carrying out a task)
        are shown as arrows. Single-headed arrows represent notifications.
        Double-headed arrows are requests, with the empty arrow head pointing
        to the task that consumes the information request, and with the full
        arrow head pointing to the task that consumes the answer (the
        requested information flows to it).</p><p>Dots indicate to-be-determined tasks. An arrow from a task to a
        dot represents an information capability of the task (information
        produced by the task that can be shared for use in other tasks). An
        arrow from a dot to a task represents an information need of the task
        (the task needs information possibly produced by other tasks).</p><p>Tasks with a blue background denote remote tasks, that is, tasks
        from another segment that are connected by sharing flows to tasks in
        the selected segment.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_2.png"></div></div><p>When a task is selected in a maximized flow map, the flow map is
        automatically de-maximized to show the summaries of the selected task
        and those of its flows.</p></div><div class="section" title="Editing tasks and flows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e325"></a>Editing tasks and flows</h3></div></div></div><p>When a task is expanded, its summary is replaced by a form with
        fields for the editable attributes of the task. The &#8220;sends&#8221; of the
        task (information shared by the task plus its information
        capabilities) and the &#8220;receives&#8221; of the task (information shared with
        the task plus its information needs) can also each be expanded into
        their edit forms.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_3.png"></div></div><p>A task is defined by first naming it. It is further defined by
        stating where it is to be executed, by whom, in what role, for what
        jurisdiction, and on behalf of what organization. Any of the location,
        agent, jurisdiction, role, and organization (entities) that specify a
        task can be left unnamed so as to imply that more than one agent can
        be assigned to the task. When the entities are named, the names can
        identify actual entities (Morritown, NJ, John Doe, ACME etc.) or types
        of entities (a city, a certified technician, a corporation
        etc.).</p><p>The execution of a task can be set to be &#8220;as a team&#8221; to indicate
        that all assignees are to work together when carrying out the task. By
        default, assignees are each to execute the task independently.</p><p>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to
        complete, whether it repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts
        automatically with the segment (implying that the assigned agents
        would become aware of the onset of the event phase on their
        own).</p><p>The purpose of a task can be stated as terminating the event
        phase of the segment, mitigating one or more risks or achieve gains
        within the segment's scope.</p><p>Related reference and policy documents can be attached to the
        task either by URL or by uploading them. Finally, the task can be
        given a brief, informal description.</p><p>When editing a &#8220;receive&#8221; or a &#8220;send&#8221;, the information needed,
        produced or to be shared is named and its elements are enumerated, and
        each assigned individual secrecy classifications and optional sourcing
        and handling instructions.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_57.png"></div></div><p>The mode of communication is given as either notification or
        by-request (push or pull).</p><p>If an information flow (information that's shared) is a
        notification, then it can be made a broadcast (information will be
        shared with all agents assigned to the target task) or a unicast
        (information will be shared with at least one agent assigned to the
        target task).</p><p>Keep in mind that an information flow that is a &#8220;send&#8221; to a task
        producing shared information is the same information flow that is a
        &#8221;receive&#8221; to the task consuming the shared information. One is looking
        at one flow from its two ends.</p><p>An information flow is created by first adding an information
        need to a task (if necessary), then adding an information capability
        of the same name in another (also if necessary), and then connecting
        the need to the capability or vice-versa by setting the &#8220;from&#8221; or &#8220;to&#8221;
        field to the other task.</p><p>A communication delay is set either to zero (communication is to
        happen without delay) or to some finite time interval. For an
        information need, the delay represents the timeliness requirement for
        being notified or for getting a response to a request. For an
        information capability, the delay represents how quickly the
        information could be produced and communicated. For a sharing flow,
        the delay represents a &#8220;quality of service&#8221; commitment.</p><p>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
        can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
        information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
        is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
        that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
        listed in order of preference.</p><p>The communication channels over which the information is to flow
        can be set for both an information need, and for a notification
        information flow but only when viewed from the notified task. The same
        is true for a requested information flow when viewed from the task
        that responds to a request. Alternate communication channels are
        listed in order of preference.</p><p>When editing a &#8220;send&#8221; or &#8220;receive&#8221;, a planner can set whether
        sharing would normally trigger or terminate a task. A notification
        could trigger or terminate the receiving task. It could also terminate
        the sending task, if sending the notification concludes the task that
        produced the information. A request could trigger the task that
        produces the requested response.</p><p>Planners can attach documents to a &#8220;send&#8221; or &#8220;receive&#8221;. A
        document can be a reference (it documents), a mandating policy (it
        obligates sharing), a prohibiting policy (it prohibits sharing), a
        multiple policy (contains language that imposes obligations and
        restrictions) or it can be an image provided as an illustration (for
        example, a screenshot). If an information flow has a prohibiting
        policy attached to it then there can not be any implied sharing
        commitment.</p><p>As with any Plan elements, a planner can add issues to those
        detected about tasks or its &#8220;sends&#8221; or &#8220;receives&#8221;. Manually added
        issues can be removed.</p></div><div class="section" title="Segment scoping"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e376"></a>Segment scoping</h3></div></div></div><p>Planners can edit the scope, name and description of a segment.
        A segment's edit form is accessed by selecting &#8220;About segment&#8221; from
        the top-most &#8220;Show&#8221; menu.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_4.png"></div></div><p>This opens a Details view on the selected segment where it can
        be renamed and where the phase and event it references can be changed.
        As with any other kind of Plan element, reference and policy documents
        can be attached to a segment.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_5.png"></div></div><p>The scope of a segment is further defined by identifying and
        describing a set of goals of organizations that relate to the
        segment's event phase. Goals can be risks to be mitigated or gains to
        be achieved. These goals are expected to be realized by tasks in the
        segment. Risks can also be curtailed by tasks that terminate the event
        phase. To be considered useful, tasks that do not curtail nor mitigate
        a risk or do not make gains are expected to at least provide
        information that is directly or indirectly needed by tasks that
        do.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Goals view</em></span> of a segment lets planners
        define the goals of organizations that are in scope. Goals can be
        added and removed. A goal is for an organization either to mitigate a
        risk or to make a gain. A goal is given a type (picked from a taxonomy
        of risks or gains), an importance (minor, major, severe for risks,
        low, medium or high for gains), the identity of the organization
        (either an actual organization or a type of organization), and whether
        the goal goes away when the event phase covered by the segment
        terminates.</p><p>The tasks that mitigate a given risk or achieve a goal in scope
        can be listed, sorted and navigated to.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_6.png"></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Map view</em></span> locates on a Google&reg; map all
        tasks in the segment that specify geo-locatable locations. The
        geo-mapping of elements is available throughout Channels.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_7.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Editing and analyzing entities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e425"></a>Editing and analyzing entities</h3></div></div></div><p>A new entity (an agent, role, organization, place, event, phase
        or communication medium) is automatically created whenever it is first
        referenced by name. Channels requires that all entities of a given
        kind be assigned unique names (John Smith, John Smith (1), John Smith
        (2) etc.).</p><p>Recall that the definitions of Plan elements can reference
        actual entities (ACME Corporation, Peter Sanchez, Morristown NJ) and
        types of entities (a corporation, a certified emergency technician, a
        city). An entity can only be tagged with entity types of its own kind
        (Warehouse A can be tagged as a building but not as a senior
        executive). Both actual entities and entity types can be edited. An
        editable and analytical view of an actual entity or type of entity can
        be opened from wherever it is referenced.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_8.png"></div></div><p>Keep in mind that events, roles and communication media in a
        Plan are always types. There is no actual event in a Plan because
        events are always anticipated. There is no such thing as an &#8220;actual
        role&#8221; because roles are always concepts. Communication media are also
        always types because a Plan only cares about the class of a
        communication medium.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Details view</em></span> of an entity enables a
        planner to change the entity's name, description, and types.</p><p>Each kind of entity has additional, specific attributes that can
        also be set. For example, a planner editing an actual organization can
        define its mission, and set its location, contact information, and
        parent organization. A planner can enforce that any sharing commitment
        by the organization with another be covered by an agreement, and that
        there be at least one known agent for each referenced role assigned by
        the organization. A planner edits the organization's employment roster
        of agents by either confirming employment implied by task in segments
        and assigning titles. A planner can also directly add new employees
        with their titles, roles and jurisdictions.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_9.png"></div></div><p>Cross-organizational sharing commitments are inferred from
        information flows in the Plan. A sharing agreement may or may not
        exist for a sharing commitment that crosses organizational boundaries.
        An unconfirmed agreement for a cross-organizational sharing commitment
        is an issue if such agreements are required for the organization. When
        viewing an organization, a planner can see the sharing commitments the
        organization makes with other organizations and confirm whether each
        commitment is covered or not by an agreement.</p><p>In the Details view of any kind of entity, references to the
        entity are listed as a filterable and paged index. Issues about the
        entity, if any, are enumerated at the bottom of the view.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_10.png"></div></div><p>In the Details view of an actual agent (as opposed to a type of
        agent), the agent, if it is a person and not a system, can be related
        to a user. The user, if not a planner, will be able to request to view
        his or her playbook (the agent's playbook) from the production version
        of the Plan. The agent can be declared to be a person or system, and
        given contact information (communication media with addresses where
        applicable) as well as clearances (secrecy classifications).</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_68.png"></div></div><p>When editing a place from within the Details view, a planner can
        identify what other place, if any, contains it. A planner can also
        give the place a street address, postal code and a geoname. If the
        geoname is ambiguous, more specific geonames are offered for
        selection.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_55.png"></div></div><p>When editing a communication medium, a planner can set the
        transmission mode to either unicast (one -to-one), multicast
        (one-to-many) or broadcast (one-to-any), unless the mode is already
        implied by another medium this one is tagged with (to make it a
        special case of the tagging medium). The address pattern is a &#8220;regular
        expression&#8221;1 that constrains the form an &#8220;address&#8221; can take for this
        medium. A planner can identify the media, if any, this one interfaces
        with as it carries out transmissions from sender to receiver. Here
        again, some of the interfaced media might be implied from another
        medium this one is tagged with. Finally, a planner can describe the
        security of the communication medium in terms of security
        classifications. Qualifying a medium as &#8220;US Gov/Top Secret&#8221; means that
        Top Secret information can be transmitted securely over this
        medium.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_67.png"></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Network view</em></span> is available on agents,
        roles, and organizations. It displays a network graph depicting how
        the entity is connected by information flows to other entities of the
        same kind. This analytical view allows a planner to filter the
        information flows to, say, show only the ones from tasks executed by a
        specific role. The network graph is navigable. The list of flows can
        be further filtered, sorted and paged. Listed flows can also be
        navigated to.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_11.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_11a.png"></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Issues view</em></span> collects and filters issues
        that are about an entity or that are related to it. Waived issues can
        be included in or excluded from the sortable, page-able list of
        issues.</p><p>Surveys, whether ongoing, closed, or to-be-created, are
        accessible from each listed issue. Only planners can launch or close
        surveys. A survey gathers the opinions of planners and non-planners
        alike on how a particular issue should be remediated.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_12.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Acquiring and releasing edit locks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e526"></a>Acquiring and releasing edit locks</h3></div></div></div><p>More than one planner can concurrently work on a Plan. To
        prevent &#8220;collisions&#8221; where two planners are attempting to modify the
        same Plan element at the same time, only one planner is permitted to
        modify any given task, flow or entity at a time.</p><p>When a planner opens an edit form on a Plan element, Channels
        attempts to grab an edit lock on behalf of the planner for that Plan
        element. If another planner already owns the lock, the form is shown
        to the first planner with the editable fields disabled.</p><p>A lock on a task, flow or entity owned by a planner is released
        when the planner collapses or closes its edit form. An inactive or

        and organizations, and that these entities can be actual or types. A
        task specification may reference entity types or omit to identify by
        name an actual agent, role, jurisdiction, etc. so as to encompass more
        than one possible agent as executor of the task. A task thus defined
        could be assigned to more than one agent.</p><p>A planner can look up the list of agents that are assigned to
        the task (the task assignments).</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_51.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_22.png"></div></div><p>Agents are implicitly bound by sharing commitments when they are
        assigned to tasks that are sources of information flows. A planner can
        look up the list of sharing commitments inferred by an information
        flow.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_52.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_23.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Assessing the impacts of failure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e588"></a>Assessing the impacts of failure</h3></div></div></div><p>Planners can assess what might happen should someone fail at an
        assigned task or should a commitment to share information be broken.
        The consequences could be a number of &#8220;downstream&#8221; tasks failing to
        make gains or mitigate or eliminate risks as planned.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_60.png"></div></div><p>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always
        complete; a failed task does not produce any information that may be
        required by others, and a failed information flow does not transfer
        any information whatsoever.</p><p>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly
        or indirectly depend critically on or are triggered by information
        that fails to be produced or to be shared.</p><p>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not
        critical to a task or does not trigger it, then its failure does not
        propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if the target of a flow can get
        the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the flow's
        failure does not matter. Finally, if information produced by an agent
        is necessarily consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure to
        share is meaningless.</p><p>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful
        tasks, that is, tasks that either achieve stated goals or produce
        information that triggers or is critical to other tasks that are
        themselves useful. (Useless tasks are flagged as issues.) Note that a
        task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end (or, more to
        the point, if it causes the event phase the segment is about to end)
        and if the risk is said to terminate with the segment.</p><p>A planner does &#8220;what-if&#8221;, failure analysis by selecting a task
        or by selecting an information flow (&#8220;send&#8221; or &#8220;receive&#8221;) and then
        looking at the consequences should it fail. The planner can take a
        pessimistic outlook and assume that all redundant information flows
        would also fail, no matter what.</p><p>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized
        as a directed graph of information flows, tasks, gains and risks.
        Risks that would otherwise be mitigated or terminated by failed tasks
        are shown as color-coded flags. Orange is for severe risks, yellow for
        major risks and blue for minor risks. Risks that would normally be
        mitigated by successful tasks are shown connected to these tasks.
        Risks that would be terminated, should a segment end, are shown
        connected to red stop lights. Each stop light is itself connected to a
        failed task that would normally end the segment.</p><p>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by
        importance, with orange for high, yellow for medium and blue for
        low.</p><p>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed,
        goal-oriented tasks (the failures that matter) is compiled and
        presented. The table is paginated and the columns (failing task,
        segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization
        impacted) can be sorted.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_58.png"></div></div><p>Failure analysis crosses segment boundaries. A failed task in
        one segment can cause tasks to fail in other segments. Tasks, flows
        and goals in segments other than the selected segment are grouped in
        blue boxes.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_59.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Actions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e632"></a>Actions</h3></div></div></div><p>Planners can create and remove segments; add, cut, copy and
        paste tasks, needs, capabilities and flows, connect tasks together
        with information flows or disconnect them. These actions are all
        available from &#8220;action&#8221; menus associated with editable Plan
        elements.</p><p>High-level actions can also be taken whenever applicable. They
        include &#8220;disintermediate&#8221; which removes a task that acts as a
        middleman in a flow, &#8220;intermediate&#8221; which adds a middleman task to a
        flow, and &#8220;satisfy needs&#8221; which automatically connects information
        needs of a task to matching but untapped information capabilities from
        other tasks.</p><p>Most actions can be undone and redone up and until a planner
        takes an action that conflicts with the undoing or redoing.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_14.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_15.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Adding and building a segment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e655"></a>Adding and building a segment</h3></div></div></div><p>When a planner creates a new segment, it is given a default name

        A task can not be removed if it is the last task in a segment.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_16.png"></div></div><p>A planner would typically first name and describe the segment,
        set its scope (identify an event phase and goals to be achieved), and
        edit the lone task. Then, additional tasks would be added, together
        with their information needs and capabilities. These tasks would be
        connected via information flows with other tasks in the selected
        segment or other segments.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_17.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Issue detection and management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e685"></a>Issue detection and management</h3></div></div></div><p>Channels automatically detects more than 60 different kinds of
        issues. Planners can manually add issues to Plan elements, describe
        these issues and suggest remediations. Manually added issues can later
        be removed.</p><p>Issue detection and remediation can provide guidance to planners
        as to what to do next when building a Plan. For example, a newly
        created segment with its lone task will immediately cause the
        detection of incompleteness issues. Resolving these incompleteness
        issues drives the planning process forward.</p><p>Some detected issues can be waived by planners if they are
        considered moot. When waiving an issue of a certain kind about a Plan
        element, all issues of this kind are also waived for the same
        element.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_18.png"></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Connecting tasks with sharing flows"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e701"></a>Connecting tasks with sharing flows</h3></div></div></div><p>After adding a task, a planner may want to give it one or more
        information needs, and, for each need, name the information required
        and list the elements of information.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_19.png"></div></div><p>When a planner names an information, Channels suggests a list of
        already used information names that look like or mean something
        similar to the name being entered. This &#8220;semantic proximity&#8221;-based,
        auto-suggest capability leverages the WordNet lexical database and is
        available throughout Channels.</p><p>A planner may want to add an information capability to a task
        (shareable information produced by the specified task) and then
        connect it to a matching information need from another task in the
        selected segment or in another segment.</p><p>Connecting a capability with a need is done by selecting a task
        with a matching need from the &#8220;From&#8221; drop-down menu in the flow form
        (and vice-versa). Connecting a need with a capability creates a new
        information flow but does not remove the connected tasks' capability
        and need.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_20a.png"></div></div><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_20b.png"></div></div><p>When a task has unsatisfied information needs (arrows to red
