        Activities. Scope can be modified at any time while a Plan is being
        built. Tasks and information flows can also be specified at any time.
        Entities (events, roles, organizations, agents, phases, places,
        transmission media etc.) can be profiled as soon they are mentioned by
        name in the specifications of tasks and information flows, the
        profiles of other entities, or in the definition of the Plan’s scope.
        A Plan should be improved early and often in order to keep it as
        manageable and as valuable as possible.</p></div><div class="section" title="Issues"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e447"/>Issues</h3></div></div></div><p>The ISP Method defines a relatively large number of issues that
        relate to a Plan’s</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>validity</em></span> (something is incorrectly
            specified or defined),</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>completeness</em></span> (something is apparently
            missing), or</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>robustness</em></span> (something makes the Plan
            failure-prone).</p></li></ul></div><p>An issue can be about the Plan as a whole or about an element of
        the Plan (a task specification, role profile, segment definition
        etc.).</p><p>An issue has a severity of low, medium, high, very high or
        extreme. The severity of an issue is either constant or computed by
        determining the severity of a potential cascade of failures caused by
        the issue.</p><p>An issue comes with one or more alternate options for
        remediation. Some issues are “best guesses” and can be waived by
        Planners.</p><p>All defined issues can be automatically detected by software.
        Planners can report other, ad hoc issues; these will typically be
        domain-specific issues.</p></div><div class="section" title="Moving to completion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e478"/>Moving to completion</h3></div></div></div><p>When is a plan complete? Because one could always increase the
        scope of a Plan, a more useful question would be: Given its current
        scope, is there something clearly missing from a Plan? If the answer
        is no, then the Plan can be considered “complete”.</p><p>Nothing is clearly missing from a Plan if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Each phase of each event in scope is addressed by at least
              one segment of the Plan (see definition of segment).</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Each segment has at least one defined goal.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Each goal listed in a segment is achieved by at least one
              task within that segment.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>All participating organizations and agents within scope
              are assigned tasks.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>All information sharing flows imply sharing commitments by
              known agents.</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>All outstanding issues are waived.</p></li></ul></div><p>The scope of a plan can be changed even after it is
        deemed complete. Plan tasks, flows and entities that do not contribute
        to completing a Plan are considered redundant. Redundant tasks, flows
        or entities should be removed from a Plan. If the scope of a Plan is
        reduced, some elements of a plan may become redundant.</p><p>There are three distinct strategies for driving a Plan to
        completion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>goals-driven</em></span>,</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>effect-driven</em></span> and</p></li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>issue-driven</em></span>.</p></li></ul></div><p>Planners will usually use of all three strategies at
        once.</p><div class="section" title="Goal-driven strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e532"/>Goal-driven strategy</h4></div></div></div><p>Planners look at each organizational goal attached to a phase
          of an anticipated event, specify tasks that achieve it, and the
          information needs of each of these tasks. They then specify tasks
          that produce the needed information and connect the tasks with
          sharing flows. This process continues until all goals are addressed
          by tasks and all task information needs are satisfied.</p><p>Tasks and flows thus specified and, consequently, the
          Procedures generated from them are necessarily within the scope of
          the Plan, since they all contribute directly or indirectly to
          addressing identified goals.</p></div><div class="section" title="Effect-driven strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e539"/>Effect-driven strategy</h4></div></div></div><p>Planners start with the onset of an event phase, specify tasks
          that are directly triggered by it. They then specify the information
          produced by the tasks. and then the tasks that would be triggered or
          terminated by sharing this information. Planners connect the tasks
          with sharing flows as appropriate. This process continues until no
          task gets triggered or terminated by information produced by
          specified tasks.</p><p>Some tasks and flows specified using this strategy (and thus
          Procedures generated from them) might not all belong within the
          scope of the Plan since they do not necessarily contribute directly
          or indirectly to addressing identified goals.</p></div><div class="section" title="Issue-driven strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a xmlns:saxon="http://icl.com/saxon" id="d0e546"/>Issue-driven strategy</h4></div></div></div><p>Planners scan the list of detected issues. Issues can be about
          validity (incorrectly defined plan elements), completeness (plan
          elements obviously missing) and robustness (Procedures are resilient
          to failures). They then select an issue to be addressed and 1- waive
          the issue (if applicable and if the issue is a false negative), or
          2- decide on applying a remediation Activity (possibly chosen from
          recommendations provided with the issue). The process is repeated
          until all outstanding issues are waived.</p><p>A Plan with no outstanding, “unwaived” issues could be
          considered valid, complete and robust, assuming that all possible
          material issues were indeed detected (an assumption that is
          impossible to verify).</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch02s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch02s04.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">From Plans to Procedures </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Activities</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
