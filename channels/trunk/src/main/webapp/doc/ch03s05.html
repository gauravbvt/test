A
      segment's edit form is accessed by selecting “About segment” from the
      top-most “Show” menu.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_4.png"/></div></div><p>This opens a Details view on the selected segment. There, the can
      be renamed and the phase and event it references can be changed. The
      event can be given the minimum rating (low, medium, high or highest) at
      which the tasks and flows in segment apply. As with any other kind of
      Plan element, reference and policy documents can be attached to a
      segment, and "ad hoc" issues can be added.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_5.png"/></div></div><p>The segment is further defined by identifying and describing a set
      of goals of organizations that relate to the segment's event phase.
      Goals can be risks to be mitigated or gains to be achieved. These goals
      are expected to be realized by tasks in the segment. A segment is
      expected to list at least one goal.</p><p>Risks can indirectly be curtailed by tasks that terminate the
      event phase. To be considered useful, tasks that do not curtail nor
      mitigate a risk or do not make gains are expected to at least provide
      information that is directly or indirectly needed by tasks that
      do.</p><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Goals view</em></span> of a segment lets planners
      define the goals of organizations that are in scope. Goals can be added
      and removed. A goal is for an organization either to mitigate a risk or
      to make a gain. A goal is given a type (picked from a taxonomy of risks
      or gains), an importance (minor, major, severe for risks, low, medium or
      high for gains), the identity of the organization (either an actual
      organization or a type of organization), and whether the goal goes away
      when the event phase covered by the segment terminates.</p><p>The tasks that mitigate a given risk or achieve a goal in scope
      can be listed, sorted and navigated to.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_6.png"/></div></div><p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>Map view</em></span> locates on a Google® map all
      tasks in the segment that specify geo-locatable locations. The
      geo-mapping of elements is available throughout Channels.</p><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="quick_tour/tour_7.png"/></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Editing tasks and flows </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Entities</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
