          the selected task (there is always a task that is selected) together with a list of
          summaries of its "receives" (the task's information needs and the information flows to it)
          and a list of its "sends" (the task's information capabilities and the information flows
          from it). Each summary can be expanded into a form for editing (if the development version
          of the plan was the one selected in the home page).</p><p>Each of the summaries is prefixed with a colored bullet. The color of the bullet
          indicates how important a task or a flow is. The color indicates the calculated impact of
          the task or the flow failing completely. Blue indicates a minor impact, yellow is major,
          orange is severe and red is extreme. Gray bullets are used when failure impact does not
          apply (information needs and capabilities).</p><p>Clicking on the summary of a task or flow expands it by opening its edit form.
          Channels automatically adapts the width of task and flow forms to ease editing. Clicking
          on the summary closes the form.</p><p>Note that, with very few exceptions, any and all fields in any form in Channels can
          be left blank.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e1790"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.51. Task, send and receive panels can be expanded</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/task_flow_panels.png" align="middle" alt="Task, send and receive panels can be expanded"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="section" title="Editing a task"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e1796"/>Editing a task</h4></div></div></div><p>A task is defined by naming it, categorizing it, tagging it and flagging, or not, as
            operational and/or prohibited. (Remember, everything is optional.) It is further defined
            by stating where it is to be executed, by whom, in what role within what jurisdiction,
            and on behalf of what organization. Any of the location, agent, jurisdiction, role, and
            organization (entities) that specify a task can be left unnamed so as to imply that more
            than one agent can be assigned to the task. The names of entities can be indicated to
            refer to actual entities (Morristown, NJ, John Doe, ACME etc.) or to types of entities (a
            city, a certified technician, a corporation etc.).</p><p>The execution of a task can be set to be “as a team” to indicate that all assigned
            agents are to work together when carrying out the task. By default, assignees are each
            to execute the task independently.</p><p>A task is also described by how long it normally takes to complete, whether it
            repeats and how quickly, and whether it starts automatically with the segment (implying
            that the assigned agents would become aware on their own of the onset of the segment's
            event phase).</p><p>The purpose of a task can be stated as causing an event, terminating the event phase
            addressed by the segment, mitigating one or more risks or achieving gains within the
            segment's scope.</p><p>Reference and policy documents can be attached to the task either by URL or by
            uploading them. Finally, the task can be given a brief, informal set of
            instructions.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e1809"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.52. Edit form for a task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/task_form.png" align="middle" alt="Edit form for a task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>As for any plan element, a planner can add issues to those automatically detected
            about the task. Issues added by a planner can be later removed by any other planner.
            Issues detected by Channels can not be removed but might be waived.</p><p>The task's "show" menu opens various "views" on the task, namely:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The details of the task as an edit form - a shortcut is to click on the task's
