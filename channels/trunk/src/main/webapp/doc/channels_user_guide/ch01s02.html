      information sharing plans (IS plans). Planning information sharing is
      done ahead of anticipated events. Channels is not meant for managing the
      actual sharing of information during a crisis.</p><p>When building IS plans using Channels, planners clarify and
      uncover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>who needs what information, why, and when</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>who has or can produce needed information, how, and
          when</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>what information should flow, when, and how</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>flaws in information sharing practices</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>how people, systems, and organizations should be

          ends up</p></li></ul></div><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e62"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.1. Channels home page</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/home_page_planner.png" align="middle" alt="Channels home page"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Building an IS plan in Channels can be divided into</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>modeling information sharing practices (IS practices)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>profiling the environment (organizations, people, and
            places) the IS practices apply to</p></li></ul></div><p>When modeling IS practices, planners describe what
      <span class="emphasis"><em>kind</em></span> of people and systems (or
      <em class="firstterm">agents</em>) are to be assigned to planned tasks. More
      importantly, planners describe what information would be acquired by the
      execution of a task and then shared with others who need it to carry out
      their own tasks. A model of IS would normally not identify task
      assignees by name, but rather specify them by their roles,
      qualifications, and/or jurisdictions and by the types of organizations
      they belong to.</p><p>When entering the profiles of people, systems, and organizations
      into an IS plan, planners do so with the expectation that profiles will
      match the descriptions of task assignees. Once assigned to a task, an
      agent can become committed to sharing information acquired by executing
      the task as specified by the (modeled) IS practices.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e87"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.2. IS practices modeling interface</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/is_modeling.png" align="middle" alt="IS practices modeling interface"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>All modeling is done via input forms. At all times, even if only
      minimal data has been entered, an IS plan can be visualized, analyzed,
      diagnosed, and applied to people and systems profiled as members of
      organizations.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e95"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.3. Sample IS modeling form in Channels - Information flow

          of failure, and other issues</p></li></ul></div><p>A model of information sharing practices is visualized primarily
      as information flow maps. Information flow maps depict (specifications
      of) tasks connected by information flows.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e118"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.4. Snippet of a flow map</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/flow_map.png" align="middle" alt="Snippet of a flow map"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Channels automatically detects issues in an IS plan (upwards of 90
      different types of issues). Issues are communicated to planners visually
      (tasks and flows drawn in red) and in other ways as well (issues panels
      throughout, all-issues table, issues summary report). The entire set of
      outstanding issues is recalculated with every change planners make to
      the plan. Planners can manually indicate issues that Channels cannot
      detect, usually because the specific issues require domain
      knowledge.</p><p>An issue has a description, a list of suggested remediations, and
      a severity level (minor, major, severe, extreme). The severity of an
      issue is either a constant for the type of issue, or it is calculated
      from the potential cascade of task failures attributable to the issue,
      in which case the severity is set by the most severe risk not mitigated
      or the most valuable gain not realized because of the failure.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e128"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.5. Examples of issue detection and reporting</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/issue_detection.png" align="middle" alt="Examples of issue detection and reporting"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Issue diagnostics is one of many kinds of analysis Channels
      performs on an IS plan. Another is failure impact analysis. Channels can
      show what would happen should a planned task not be performed or should
      some information not be shared as planned.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e136"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.6. Failure impact analysis</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/failure_impacts.png" align="middle" alt="Failure impact analysis"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Other questions Channels can answer about IS practices once
      modeled are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Where would an element for information come from or end up
            according to plan?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Would it arrive in time?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How is it transformed along the way?</p></li></ul></div><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e154"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.7. Dissemination analysis - from sources</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/dissemination_from_sources.png" align="middle" alt="Dissemination analysis - from sources"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Channels applies the modeled IS practices to actual people and
      systems based on the roles they play in organizations. The results are
      personalized IS guidelines that can be accessed online by participants
      in the plan and printed.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e162"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.8. Snippet from IS guidelines</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/guidelines_in_out.png" align="middle" alt="Snippet from IS guidelines"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>By applying modeled IS practices to known people and systems in
      organizations, Channels can determine how organizations ought to be
      networked for an IS plan to be realized.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d1917e170"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.9. An organization's network based on an IS plan</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/organization_network.png" align="middle" alt="An organization's network based on an IS plan"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>While the effort required to model IS practices far exceeds that
      of simply drawing information flow maps using a drawing tool, the
      benefits of modeling IS practices using Channels are substantial and
      include the automated generation of personalized IS guidelines, issue
      detection, and analyses that illuminate the properties and consequences
      of applying these practices.</p><p>Channels is to information sharing what spreadsheets are to
      financial planning, and what Business Process Modeling is to business
      operations.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 1. Information Sharing Planning </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> ISP Concepts </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
