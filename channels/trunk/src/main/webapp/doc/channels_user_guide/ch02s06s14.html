          assigned task or should an agent break a commitment to share information. The consequences
          could be a number of “downstream” tasks failing leading to gains unachieved or risks
          unmitigated.</p><p>For the sake of analysis, it is assumed that a failure is always complete; a failed
          task does not produce any information that may be required by others, and a failed
          information flow does not transfer any information whatsoever.</p><p>A failure can cause a cascade of task failures if tasks directly or indirectly depend
          critically on or are triggered by information that fails to be produced or to be
          shared.</p><p>Not all sharing failures matter. If an information flow is not critical to a task or
          does not trigger it, then its failure does not propagate to other tasks. Furthermore, if
          the target of a flow can get the same information via another, non-failing flow, then the
          failure of the flow may not matter. Finally, if information produced by an agent is necessarily
          consumed by the same agent then, clearly, failure to share is meaningless.</p><p>Failure analysis only concerns itself with the failure of useful tasks, that is, tasks
          that either achieve stated goals or produce information that triggers or is critical to
          other tasks that are themselves useful. (Useless tasks are flagged as issues.) Note that a
          task will terminate a risk if it causes a segment to end (or, more to the point, if it
          causes the event phase the segment is about to end) and if the risk is said to terminate
          with the segment.</p><p>A planner does “what-if”, failure analysis by selecting a task or by selecting an
          information flow (“send” or “receive”) and then looking at the consequences should it
          fail. The planner can take a pessimistic outlook and assume that all redundant information
          flows would also fail, no matter what.</p><p>The result of the analysis is a cascade of failures visualized as a directed graph of
          information flows, tasks, gains and risks. Risks that would otherwise be mitigated or
          terminated by failed tasks are shown as color-coded flags. Red is for extreme risks,
          orange is for severe risks, yellow for major risks and blue for minor risks. Risks that
          would normally be mitigated by successful tasks are shown connected to these tasks. Risks
          that would be terminated, should a segment end, are shown connected to red stop lights.
          Each stop light is itself connected to a failed task that would normally end the
          segment.</p><p>Missed gains are shown as stars and are similarly color-coded by importance, with red
          for very high, orange for high, yellow for medium and blue for low.</p><p>In addition to the visual map, a tabular list of failed, goal-achieving tasks (the
          failures that matter) is compiled and presented. The table is paginated and the columns
          (failing task, segment, impact, goal, magnitude of the loss, and organization impacted)
          can be sorted.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e2941"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.128. Accessing the failure impact analysis on a task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/failure_impact_access_task.png" align="middle" alt="Accessing the failure impact analysis on a task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><div class="figure"><a id="d0e2947"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.129. Failure impacts of a failed task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/reference/failure_impact_task.png" align="middle" alt="Failure impacts of a failed task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Failure analysis crosses segment boundaries.
