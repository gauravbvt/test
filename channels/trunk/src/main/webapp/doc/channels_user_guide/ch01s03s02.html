            practices</em> applied to an <em class="firstterm">environment</em>.
          Information sharing practices are definitions of tasks and the information flows between
          them. An environment is composed of agents (people and systems) in roles of responsibility
          within organizations. These agents are assigned to flow-connected tasks and consequently
          have information sharing commitments.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e265"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.11. Flow-connected tasks in the IS practices model of an IS plan</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/flow_map.png" align="middle" alt="Flow-connected tasks in the IS practices model of an IS plan"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>In order to separate (decouple) IS practices and environment, it is recommended to
          model IS practices without mentioning actual organizations or actual people or systems.
          It is best to specify tasks as being executed by "disembodied" roles from
            <span class="emphasis"><em>types</em></span> of organizations (e.g. a "forensic autopsy" is to be
          carried by a "coroner" from a "county health office"). IS practices models that are not
          attached to a particular environment can be applied, possibly with some local adaptations,
          to various environments.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e276"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.12. Profile of an actual organization populating the environment of an IS plan</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/profiling_organization_actual_1.png" align="middle" alt="Profile of an actual organization populating the environment of an IS plan"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>An IS plan's environment identifies the actual people or systems that play the
          organizational roles mentioned in the IS practices model (or IS model for short). For
          example, planners could build an IS model for responding to an epidemic outbreak at the
          state level, and then apply the same IS model to different states, each state being a
          different environment with its own organizations and role-assigned agents.</p><p>Note that there is not yet explicit support in the current release of Channels for
          separately managing the IS model and environment of an IS plan, or for explicitly
          composing IS plans by applying one reusable IS model to different environments. A
          forthcoming release of Channels will provide such support. In the meanwhile, planners are
          strongly encouraged to follow the above best practice of keeping the IS model as decoupled
          as possible from the IS plan's environment.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03s03.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">ISP concepts </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Event phases, goals and segments</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
