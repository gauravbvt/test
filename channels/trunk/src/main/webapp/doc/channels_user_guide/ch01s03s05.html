          transmission media and phases of events. These are referred to in ISP as entities. An ISP
          entity is anything that can be named in an IS plan but is neither a task nor information.
          An ISP entity is always unambiguously referenced by name in a plan, its segments, tasks
          and flows, or in the profiles of other entities. There can only be one agent named "John
          Doe", only one event named "lawsuit filed" etc. </p><p>There are actual entities and there are types of entities. Actual entities (“Jane
          Smith”, “ACME Inc.”, “Morristown, Morris County, NJ, USA” etc.) are categorized by types
          of entities (“Senior executive”, “Corporation”, “City” etc.). Entity types can refine
          other entity types (a “Senior executive” is a kind of “Executive”).</p><p>Actual entities can be categorized by entity types of the same kind (agents are
          categorized by agent types etc.) but entity types themselves can be categorized by other
          entity types, thus forming implicit typologies.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e490"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.25. A typology of roles</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/typology_role.png" align="middle" alt="A typology of roles"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>An <em class="glossterm">agent</em> is either a person or an information system (system
          for short). An agent is capable of sending notifications, answering queries, receiving
          notifications or sending queries. An agent has contact information and availability (24/7
          by default). An agent's clearance is a list of secrecy classifications (e.g. NATO Top
          Secret and US Gov. Secret.) </p><p>An agent type can be thought of as a qualification that can be shared by different
          agents (e.g. "Adult" or "Registered driver"). An agent type is not to be confused with a
          role. A role implies responsibilities whereas an agent type denotes qualifications or
          status. </p><p>An agent can be flagged as a system (non-human). </p><p>When a group of agents are indistinguishable from a planning perspective (for example,
          call center operators), they can be profiled as a single <em class="glossterm">archetype</em>
          agent (for example, "a call center operator"). </p><p>When the identity of an agent is to be resolved by associating the agent with one or
          more users of Channels, the agent is marked as a <em class="firstterm">placeholder</em>.
          (More on this later.) Agents are references in the definitions of tasks and of
          organizations (their members and their supervisors).</p><p>An <em class="glossterm">organization</em> is a group of agents organized to accomplish a
          mission. An organization assigns roles of responsibility to the persons and systems that
          act on its behalf. An organization has contact information and may contain other
          organizations. An organization may have information sharing agreements with other
          organizations to formalize the sharing commitments its members have with members of other
          organizations. Organizations are referenced in the definitions of a plan itself
          (organizations that are expected to participate), in segments (organizational risks),
          tasks and as parents of other organizations.</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">role</em> is a set of powers and responsibilities bestowed by an
          organization to an agent acting on behalf of the organization. A role assignment may be
          restricted to a jurisdiction (a place). A role is always an entity type. Roles are
          referenced in tasks and in organizations (roles played by their members).</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">place</em> is either a geographical area (some city, county,
          state, country, natural preserve etc.) or a known location (some train station, building
          etc.). A place can be contained in another (for example, a building can be in a campus).
          Places are referenced in a plan's definition (the plan's default locale), in events (an
          event and an event type can both be located to a place), in tasks (location of execution
          and jurisdiction of assignees), in organizations (address and jurisdictions of
          members).</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">phase</em> names a time period relative to events. A phase is
          either set to before, during or after events. Typical phases are “Preparing”, “Responding”
          and “Recovering”. A phase is always an entity type. Phases are referenced in a plan's
          definition (phases in scope), and in segments (event phase in focus and event phases in
          context).</p><p>A <em class="glossterm">transmission medium</em> is a means by which agents transmit
          information to one another. Transmission media may or may not be technology-based. A
          medium is either unicast (transmits to a single, known agent), multicast (transmits to
          multiple, known agents) or broadcast (little to no control over who receives the
          transmission). “Telephone”, “Email”, “Instant Messaging” are examples of unicast
          communication media, and so is “Face-to-face”. “Notification system” and “Meeting” are
          both multicast media. “Television”, “Radio” and “PA System” are examples of broadcast
          media. </p><p>A transmission medium can delegate transmissions to other media. For example, VoIP can
          interface with Telephones. The security of a medium is expressed in terms of secrecy
          classifications. A transmission medium is always an entity type. Transmission media are
          referenced in the definitions of communication channels. Communication channels are used
          to define information flows, needs and capabilities, and the contact information of agents
          and organizations.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03s04.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03s06.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Flows and tasks </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Secrecy, security and clearances</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
