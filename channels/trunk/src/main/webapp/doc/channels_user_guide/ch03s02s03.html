There is really no satisfactory answer to this question.
          Because one could always increase the scope of a plan, a more useful question would be:
          Given its current scope, is there something clearly missing from a plan? If the answer is
          no, then the plan can be deemed “complete”.</p><p>Knowing whether the scope of an IS plan is properly set requires knowing the
          domains of human endeavor involved and being able to identify the organizations that ought
          to participate in the plan. Absent this knowledge, software can only examine an IS plan to
          detect what is inherently missing from it.</p><p>Nothing is inherently missing from a plan if:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Each phase of each event in scope is addressed by at least one segment of the
                plan.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If an event is not self-terminating, each segment addressing a co-event phase
                for that event has at least one task that terminates the segment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each segment has at least one defined goal.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each goal listed in a segment is achieved by at least one task within that
                segment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each participating organization and agent within scope is assigned at least one
                task.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each task is assigned to at least one agent.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each information sharing flow generates at least one information sharing
                commitment.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each task is useful in that it directly achieves a goal, or directly or
                indirectly enables a task that does.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each referenced role in an organization is assigned to at least one member agent
                (if required).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Each inter-organizational info sharing commitment is covered by a sharing
                agreement documented by a Memorandum of Understanding (if required).</p></li></ul></div><p>The scope of an IS plan can be changed even after it is deemed complete.
          Tasks, flows and entities that do not contribute to completing a plan are considered
          redundant. Redundant tasks, flows or entities should be removed from a plan. If the scope
          of a plan is reduced, some elements of a plan may become redundant as a result.</p><p>The ISP Method proposes three distinct strategies for driving an IS plan toward
          completion:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Goal-driven</em></span> - Add goal-achieving tasks and work backward to
              satisfy their information needs.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Effect-driven</em></span> - Add tasks that execute at the onset of event
              phases and work forward by connecting tasks with outgoing flows.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Issue-driven</em></span>. - Resolve or waive outstanding issues until
              none remains. </p></li></ul></div><p>Planners usually use of all three strategies opportunistically when building an IS
          plan.</p><div class="section" title="Goal-driven strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="d0e3494"/>Goal-driven strategy</h4></div></div></div><div class="figure"><a id="d0e3497"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.7. Goal-driven IS plan building</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_driven.png" align="middle" alt="Goal-driven IS plan building"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Planners look at each organizational goal attached to a phase of an anticipated
            event, add tasks that achieve it, and add the information needs of each of these tasks.
            They then add tasks that produce the needed information and connect the tasks with
            information flows. This process continues until all goals are addressed by tasks, and
            all task information needs are satisfied.</p><p>Step 1 - Select a goal within a segment</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e3507"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.8. A risk mitigation goal in a segment</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_select_goal.png" align="middle" alt="A risk mitigation goal in a segment"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Step 2 - Add a task that achieves the goal</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e3515"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.9. Adding a task that mitigates the risk</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_add_task.png" align="middle" alt="Adding a task that mitigates the risk"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Step 3 - Specify the information needs of the task</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e3523"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.10. Defining the information needs of the risk-mitigating task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_info_need.png" align="middle" alt="Defining the information needs of the risk-mitigating task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Step 4 - Add a flow-connected task to satisfy a need</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e3531"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.11. A task and flow are added to satisfy an information need</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/strategy_goal_flow.png" align="middle" alt="A task and flow are added to satisfy an information need"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Systematic use of a goal-driven strategy guarantees that all tasks and flows and
            consequently the IS procedures generated from them are within the scope of the IS plan,
            because all tasks and flows contribute directly or indirectly to addressing identified
            goals. However, this strategy alone does not guarantee that tasks triggered by the start
            of event phases will be included. In other words, this "working from the end" strategy
            does not guarantee that it will reach all starting points.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch03s02s02.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch03s02.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch03s02s03s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Issues </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Effect-driven strategy</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
