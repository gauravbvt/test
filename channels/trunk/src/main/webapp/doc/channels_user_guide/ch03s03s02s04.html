          express the requirement that agents executing the source task commit
          to share information with agents executing the target task, possibly
          subject to some restrictions. The information is either produced by
          or acquired for the execution of the source task, and the
          information is to be used for the execution of the target task. The
          same flow appears to the source task in its list of "sends" and to
          the target task in its list of "receives".</p><p>A planner connects a source and target task by doing any of
          the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Opening an information capability of the source-to-be
                task and identifying or creating the target task in the "To
                task" field. The target task can be created in situ by
                selecting "Other..." in the list of candidate target tasks and
                naming a task that does not yet exist within the
                segment.</p><p>If the flow is between tasks in the same segment, the
                information need is converted into an information flow; to
                preserve the information need, the planner must duplicate it
                and set the source on only the copy or the original. If the
                flow is between tasks in different segments, the information
                need is preserved when the flow is created.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Opening an information need of the target-to-be task and

                "Other..." in the list of candidate source tasks and naming a
