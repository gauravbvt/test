      correct a mistake in the definition of an IS plan, bring the plan closer
      to completion, or make it more robust.</p><p>An activity is composed of a number of steps, all of which may be
      optional, often to be carried out in no particular order. Most
      activities can be undone (for example, a task added to the IS plan can
      be later removed). Prerequisites for an activity, if there are any, are
      usually few and commonsensical. For example, a task in a segment cannot
      be specified unless the segment is already defined.</p><p>Note that for each "Add ..." activity there is usually an implied
      and related "Remove ..." and "Modify ..." activity. For example, "Add
      task" implies "Remove task" and "Modify task".</p><p>Prior to applying any activity, it is assumed that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>An IS plan has been created and given a unique identifier (the

          participating organizations but also participating agents, that is,
          agents as role-playing members of organizations that can be assigned
          to tasks. Agents "employed by organizations" are added to the scope
          implicitly from the definitions of tasks, or explicitly by defining
          the "jobs" of participating organizations that are relevant to the
          plan.</p><p>Since it is a best practice not to directly identify the
          assignees of tasks but rather to specify them via their roles in
          types of organizations, the preferred approach for identifying
          participating agents is to list them with their jobs in the profiles
          of participating organizations.</p><p>An agent is further identified by associating one or more
          users to it. The meaning of associating a user to an actual agent
          depends on whether the agent is designated as an archetype, a
          placeholder, or (the default) a normal agent.</p><p>An archetype agent captures the notion of a group of anonymous
          and indistinguishable agents (same contact info, same roles in the
          same organizations). An "ACME Call Center Agent" would be an
          archetype playing the role of "Call Center Agent" for the
          organization "ACME" and with some 1-800 number as its communication
          channel. Any number of Channels users can be associated with an
          archetype. These users all receive the IS guidelines of their
          associated archetype.</p><p>A placeholder agent is an agent whose identity is to be given
          via their associations with users. A placeholder agent can be given
          default contact information that the associated user(s) can override
          and add to. A placeholder agent can be restricted to only one
          associated user or can be open to associations with many users. A
          user associated with a placeholder agent gets the IS guidelines of
          that agent, with the user's contact info
          substitutions/additions.</p><p>The default kind of actual agent directly identifies the
          person or system and provides contact information as part of the
          profile. Only one user can be associated by planners with a normal,
          actual agent. The full name of the user and of the agent are
          expected to match (an issue is raised if not). The associated user
          gets the agent's IS guidelines. It is an ISP best practice to define
          agents, as much as possible, either as archetypes or as
          placeholders.</p><table frame="box" id="d1917e3864"><caption>Table 3.5. Scoping: Identify a participating agent</caption><col width="20%"/><col width="80%"/><tbody><tr>

          composed of segments, each focusing on one phase of one event,
          possibly in the context of other past or current events. Each
          segment defines a list of organizational goals to be achieved via
          flow-connected tasks. Adding a segment contributes to setting the
          scope of a plan, because doing so is a prerequisite to adding
          organizational goals that contribute to the scope.</p><table frame="box" id="d1917e3964"><caption>Table 3.6. Scoping: Add a plan segment</caption><col width="20%"/><col width="80%"/><tbody><tr>
