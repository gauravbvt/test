          commits to share certain information with another organization. </p><p>Channels finds the information sharing commitments of agents between each pair of
          organizations and, for each "networking" pair, aggregates the commitments into distinct
          "information sharing relationships". Each information sharing relationship is a summary of
          sharing commitments for some information (the agents in the commitments and their roles
          are abstracted out). For example, an information sharing relationship would summarize the
          fact that members of Bank A commit to share fraud information with members of Bank B. For
          each such relationship, planners can indicate whether an information sharing commitment
          has been formalized and attach or link to a document formalizing the agreement.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e729"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.36. The sharing agreements of an organization</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/agreements.png" align="middle" alt="The sharing agreements of an organization"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>An organization may require that its sharing commitments with other organizations
          be covered by sharing agreements. If there is an exception to this rule, an issue is
          raised by Channels. Furthermore, if a sharing agreement is confirmed but not documented,
          an issue is also raised. Note that in applying these constraints Channels does not
          distinguish when both organizations belong to a common organization and when they do
          not.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03s09.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03s11.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Expressing exceptions by overriding tasks and flows </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Descriptions, instructions and attachments</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
