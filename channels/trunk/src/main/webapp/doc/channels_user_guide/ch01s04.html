      Planning is "How is different from Business Process Management"?</p><p>To answer this question, one must first consider that Information
      Sharing Planning (ISP) is part of something larger called Information
      Sharing Management.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Information Sharing Management</em></span> (ISM) is a set
      of technologies and best practices that help communities of
      organizations share information more effectively in order to achieve
      their missions when preparing for, responding to, and recovering from
      actual events. Information Sharing Planning (ISP) produces the
      information sharing procedures that organizations apply when actually
      sharing information. ISP analyzes these procedures for continuous
      improvement.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Business Process Management</em></span> (BPM) helps
      enterprises become more efficient, more effective, and more agile in how
      they each operate. Business Process Modeling captures and analyzes
      business processes for continuous improvement.</p><p>Because ISP relates most closely to Business Process Modeling, the
      question should be recast to "How do Information Sharing Management and
      Business Process Management differ"?</p><p>Other questions are "Can ISM and BPM be used together"? and "How
      do the markets for BPM and ISM compare"?</p><div class="section" title="Differences"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="d1917e905"/>Differences</h3></div></div></div><p>BPM and ISM tackle different problems from different
        perspectives.</p><p>BPM focuses "inward" on a single (but possibly extended)
        enterprise. It looks at how the enterprise responds internally to
        events, and at how it renders services to its customers. The end is
        maximizing value creation while minimizing costs. The means is
        business process improvement.</p><p>ISM focuses "outward" on (often ad hoc) communities of
        organizations. It looks at how organizations depend on one another to
        get the information they need to execute tasks that achieve
        organizational goals. The end is minimizing the impacts of systemic
        risks and maximizing the capture of opportunities. The means is better
        information sharing.</p><p>While there is conceptual overlap (both ISM and BPM involve
        tasks, events, and communications) and even though they both use
        somewhat similar-looking visualizations (directed graphs), ISM and BPM
        have very different world views. BPM looks at the operations of an
        enterprise, whereas ISM looks at the information flows between a
        community of organizations. They also differ in their goals: BPM
        optimizes enterprise value creation whereas ISM reduces the impacts of
        systemic risks.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03s12.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s04s02.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Tagging </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Similarities</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
