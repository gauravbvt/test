          be made either all the time, upon witnessing the start or end of an event, or upon
          receiving a notification or a request for information. In defining a task, planners
          normally do not identify by name the actual agents to be assigned to the tasks but rather
          describe their profile in terms of their qualifications (as agent types), roles,
          jurisdictions (as named places or types of places) and/or organizations (by name or by
          type).</p><p>It is left to Channels to look up agents in the plan's environment (agents that are
          identified as role-playing members of organizations that are in scope) and see which ones
          fit the profile of a task's assignees. If a task is meant for any "CPR trained" (agent
          type) "Security Officer" (role) at a "Government Agency" (organization type), then all
          known agents who are categorized (directly or indirectly) as "CPR trained", work for an
          organization categorized (directly or indirectly) as a "Government Agency" in the role of
          "Security Officer" (or a role categorized as such) will be assigned to the task. </p><p>What is meant by "directly or indirectly"? Let's say that FBI (an actual
          organization) is categorized as both a "Law Enforcement Agency" and "Federal Agency", and
          "Federal Agency" is categorized as a "Government Agency", then the FBI would directly
          match "Law Enforcement Agency" and indirectly match "Government Agency".</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e648"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.32. Agents assigned to a task</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/assignments.png" align="middle" alt="Agents assigned to a task"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Any agent assigned to a task that sends information to another task (i.e. is
          connected by a flow targeting the other task) commits to share it with some or all agents
          assigned to the task receiving the information. A task assigned to three agents with a
          flow targeting another task assigned to two agents might imply six different information
          sharing commitments, one from each assignee of the information-producing task to each
          assignee of the information-consuming task.</p><p>If the flow is annotated as "to every", then the commitment is to share it with all
          assignees of the target task, otherwise the flow is "to any" and the commitment is to
          share with at least one of the assignees of the target task.</p><p>Not all assignees of the target task are necessarily eligible to be beneficiaries
          of information sharing commitments (commitments for short). Commitments can be subject to
          restrictions or prohibitions. Commitments can be restricted to agents in the same or
          different organization or in organizations with the same parent organizations. They can be
          restricted to agents in the same location or different location, to agents who are
          supervisors. Commitments can be restricted to one self, which may sound odd until one
          realizes that an agent might uncover information doing a task, keep it to oneself and
          start another task on the basis of this information (an agent has in essence notified
          itself to trigger another task). Commitments can also be restricted to "someone else" or
          to agents in both the same organization and location.</p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e660"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.33. Sharing commitments derived from assignments to tasks connected by a flow</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="user_guide_images/commitments.png" align="middle" alt="Sharing commitments derived from assignments to tasks connected by a flow"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>A flow can be marked as "prohibited", in which case no commitments are implied, no
          matter who is assigned to the source and target tasks. Flow prohibition is used to specify
          "exceptions to the rules" in IS plans. (More on that later.)</p><p>An agent's information sharing procedures (IS procedures) is the list of all task
          assignments for the agent plus all associated information sharing commitments. An agent's
          information sharing guidelines are produced from the IS procedures computed by Channels
          for that agent. </p><div class="figure"><a id="d0e670"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 1.34. Computing information sharing procedures</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="user_guide_images/IS_procedures.png" alt="Computing information sharing procedures"/></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"/><p>Many analytics in Channels (dissemination, impact failure, network, various type of
          issues) depend on the computing of IS procedures for all agents in an IS plan. Because
          matching of profiles involves entity types, the proper design of typologies (for agents,
          roles, places, organizations etc.) is key to successfully building IS plans.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s03s07.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01s03.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03s09.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">The meaning of information in ISP </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="channels_user_guide.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Expressing exceptions by overriding tasks and flows</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
