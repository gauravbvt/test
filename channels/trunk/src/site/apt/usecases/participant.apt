Participant Use Cases
	
* What is a participant?

	A participant is a user who is authorized by the representative of an organization to participate 
	in projects in which the organization is invited, representing the role(s) he/she plays in that organization.
	A participant may be given the status of contributor or guest in a project. 
	
	The difference between a contributing participant and a guest participant is that a guest can not create, publish nor build scenarios.
	
	A user who plays many roles or roles in more than one organization would login only once but would assume one "persona" at a time within a project to indicate
	on behalf of what role and organization he/she is making each contribution. A user can set a default persona that is set after each login.

	[]

** {Modify profile}

	A participant's profile is information that describes the participant in any of the projects he/she may participate in.
	This augments the identity information in the user profile (the user will likely manage both user and participant profiles together).

	A participant can:
	
	* {{{#view_roles} View roles}}
	
	* {{{#add_role} Add role}}
	
	* {{{#remove_role} Remove role}}
	
	* {{{#edit_role} Edit role}}
	
	* {{{#edit_contact_info} Edit contact info}}
	
	[]

*** {View roles}

	TBD

*** {Add role}

	TBD

*** {Remove role}

	TBD
	
*** {Edit role}

	TBD

*** {Edit contact info}

	TBD

** {Browse projects}

	The user is presented with a list of all named projects in which he/she is a manager, participant or guest.
	The user can select a project to see all named models created in this project.
	The user can select one, many or all models and view all named scenarios in the selected model(s).
	
	The participant can view:
	
	* the past and current popularity of a model and scenario (as contributions over time and number of contributors) 
	
	* the informal description and the objectives of a selected project and model (about),
	
	* the informal description of a selected scenario (about),
	
	* the list of all participants in a selected project,
	
	* the list of all contributors to a selected model or scenario.
	
	[]
	
	The user can do {{{#search projects}keyword searches}} on projects.
	
** {Search projects}

	While browsing authorized projects, the user can search them using keywords. The search will retrieve projects, models, scenarios and 
	scenario elements that contain any/all of the keywords in their descriptions.
	
	The search results shows the "containment path" of each result (project/model/scenario/event etc.).
	A link to each result and let's the user open a default viewer on it or any element that contains it.
	
** {View a scenario}

	The participant can examine a scenario along multiple perspectives:
	
	* A timeline of events, reponse tasks, task outcomes and environments (where communication channels are restricted and/or a different set of policies apply),
	
	* A geographical mapping of the above occurences and agents involved,
	
	* A social network connecting the agents and organizations involved
	
	* A list of information exchanges required in order to execute the above response tasks.
	
	[]
	
	The timeline is the principal view. The timeline elements can be multi-selected. Selecting elements in it
	makes them or related elements appear in the other perspectives. Selecting none is the same as selecting all
	(selection equates focusing).
	
	Selecting one or more timeline elements will make all their related agents (i.e who carries out the response tasks and
	what organizations they are from) appear in the social net and in the map; the exchanges they necessitate also appear in
	as a tabular list of exchanges.
		
** {Assume persona}

	A participant can "wear many hats", that is, he/she may be playing different roles in more than one organization. When making assertions, the participant can
	authoritatively say something about himself/herself in a given role, or the participant may express an opinion about some other role, possibly not in his/her organization.
	In both cases, the user makes a contribution to the project as someone in a given role in a given organization.
	
	Before making any contribution, the participant must assume as persona one of the roles he/she plays in an organization. That persona is in effect until the participant
	changes it. The default persona is a user setting.
	
** {Create and publish scenarios}

	Any participant can create and publish a scenario in a project but only a manager for that project can close or even delete a scenario once it has been published.
	Until a scenario is published, it is considered a draft and is visible and modifiable only by the participant who created it. 
	
	A participant first creates a draft scenario, describes it and minimally builds it before publishing it so that others can see it and take part in building it.
	A draft scenario can only be deleted by the participant who created it.
	
	The participant can:
	
	* {{{#create_a_draft_scenario} Create a draft scenario}}
	
	* {{{#initialize_a_draft_scenario} Initialize a draft scenario}}
	
	* {{{#delete_a_draft_scenario} Delete a draft scenario}}
	
	* {{{#publish_a_draft_scenario} Publish a draft scenario}}

	[]

*** {Create a draft scenario}

	The participant selects a model in a project and requests that a scenario be created. 
	A form appears in which the user enters:
	
	 * a name,
	 
	 * an informal description,
	 
	 * objectives for the scenario
	 
	 []
	 
	 The participant can submit the form or cancel the creation of a draft scenario. Upon submitting, the scenario viewer is opened on the draft scenario for it to be initialized.
	 	 
*** {Initialize a draft scenario}
	 
	 If the scenario viewer is not open on a draft scenario, the participant can access a list of draft scenarios, select one of them and open a scenario viewer on it.
	 The participant can then add the incidents (defining events) and environments that will impose constraints on resources and alter the policy landscape.
	 The participant can build up the scenario as much as desired while it is in draft mode.
	 
	 The other scenarios visible to the participant are searched for similarities (based on event types of incidents primarily) and brought to the attention of the participant,
	 the goal being to avoid the creation of redundant scenarios.

*** {Delete a draft scenario}

	The participant selects a draft scenario and requests its deletion. The participant is asked for confirmation before permanently removing the draft scenario.
	The participant can cancel the deletion.

*** {Publish a draft scenario}

	The participant selects one of his/her draft scenarios and requests that it be published. If the scenario is insufficiently initialized (e.g. no incident or objectives), then the request
	is rejected and the participant is told why.
	
	If the scenario is successfully published, it then becomes visible to other participants. The participant retains authoritive editing rights to the elements that were defined
	prior to publishing the scenario and to all incidents (events that don't have other scenario elements as cause). In other words, other participants are not allowed to change
	the nature of the scenario; they are only allowed to elaborate on it.
	
	The publication of a scenario is an event of which all participants are notified.

** {Build a scenario}

	A participant contributes to a scenario by making assertions about existing elements in the scenario. An element is anything that composes a scenario such as events,
	tasks, outcomes, exchanges, and assertions made about them. This means that assertions can be made about assertions where meaningful (e.g. "I need to know if he knows")

	The participant can:
	
	* {{{#make_assertions} Make assertions}}
	
	* {{{#add_event} Add event}}
	
	* {{{#add_outcome} Add outcome}}
	
	* {{{#add_agent} Add agent}}
	
	* {{{#add_organization} Add organization}}
	
	* {{#describe_element} Describe element}}
	
	* {{#accept_or_reject_a_suggestion} Accept or reject a suggested element}}
	
	[]

*** {Make assertions}

	An assertion is a statement about a scenario element indicating that information is needed or available, or that a given event is to be responded to by the execution of a task,
	or that access to given agent is authorized, or that a given information exchange is agreed to. These assertions are either made authoritatively for one of the participant's
	persona (one of the roles he/she plays), or, meant as an opinion, for some other role in some organization.

	The participant can make the following assertions:
	
	* {{{#needs_to_know} Needs to know}}
	
	* {{{#knows} Knows}}
	
	* {{{#responds_to} Responds to}}
	
	* {{{#can_access} Can access}}
	
	* {{{#agrees_to} Agrees to}}
	
	[]
	
**** {Needs to know}

	The participant selects a scenario element anywhere it is shown (from a timeline, map, exchanges list etc.) and "tags" it with a "needs to know".
	The participant indicates who needs to know (default = current persona, else selects from other persona or a list of roles in organizations) and describes the need further.
	
	The participant can later modify or remove the assertion.

**** {Knows}

	The participant selects a scenario element anywhere it is shown (from a timeline, map, exchanges list etc.) and "tags" it with a "knows".

	The participant indicates who knows (default = current persona, else selects from other persona or a list of roles in organizations).

	An information asset is created and is attached to the assertion.

	The participant describes the information asset further.
	
	The participant can later modify or remove the assertion.

**** {Responds to}

	The participant selects an event already described in a scenario and tags it with "responds to".
	The participant indicates who responds to the event (default = current persona, else selects from other persona or a list of roles in organizations). A task is automatically created and added to the scenario. The participant selects it and describes it.
	
	Alternately, the participant selects a task already described in the scenario and tags it with "also responds".
	The participant indicates who else also responds to the event by executing this task (default = current persona, else selects from other persona or a list of roles in organizations).
	
	The participant can later modify or remove the assertion.

**** {Can access}

	The participant selects an agent already described in a scenario and tags it with "can access" (meaning "has been granted access").

	The participant indicates who has been granted access to the agent (default = current persona, else selects from other persona or a list of roles in organizations).

	The participant may qualify this granted access by restricting it to one or more of the scenario's environments.

	The participant can later modify or remove the assertion.

**** {Agrees to}

	The participant selects an exchange already described in a scenario and tags it with "agree to" (meaning "has been granted access") only if one of the
	participant's persona is one of the agents represented in the exchange. 

	If the persona is on the receiving end, then the participant indicates willingness to receive the information.
	If the persona is on the sending end, then the participant indicates willingness to send the information.

	The participant may qualify this agreement to exchange information by restricting it to one or more of the scenario's environments.

	The participant can later modify or remove the assertion.

*** {Add event}

	The participant selects an existing element of the scenario that can be a source of events and selects from a list of types of events that this element can generate.
	An event is created over which the participant has authority and is attached to its causal element. 
	The participant can further describe the event.

	<Note that only a participant with authority over a scenario (its creator or the project manager) can add an event with no scenario element as its cause (i.e. an incident).>

*** {Add outcome}

	The participant selects an existing task in the scenario and adds an outcome to it.
	The participant describes the outcome.
	
*** {Add agent}

	An agent can be a role, a person or an information resource. One may need to introduce an agent in a scenario that is not represented by a participant.
	A participant creates a role or an information resource within a project and describes it. This may be done from anywhere in a project but the action should be readily available
	wherever a participant makes an assertion and needs to identify an agent.

	If the agent is described as belonging to an organization and there is a representative for that organization (now or later), then the representative has authority over the agent's description.
	Otherwise the agent is a public element visible to all projects.
	
	If the agent is a role and a participant joins the projet for that role (the description of a role includes the identity of an organization), then this participant acquires authority over the
	until then public agent description.

*** {Add organization}

	One may need to introduce an organization for which there is no representative.
	A participant creates an organization and describes it. This may be done anywhere in a project but should be readily available wherever a participant describes an agent.
	
	If the organization later gains a representative, that representative acquires authority over the description of the organization.
	Until then, the description of the organization is a public system element (visible to all projects).

*** {Describe element}

	A participant generally can modify the description of any editable element in Channels he/she can access.
	When a participant creates an element, he/she must minimally describe it before it is added.
	
	An element is anything that appears in a scenario or is referenced by that element.
	The participant should be able to select an element wherever and however it is shown (in a list, a map, a graph, an editor etc.) and
	be able to request to edit it. 
	
	If the participant has contributor status in the current project, the editor opens as "read/write", else it opens as "read-only".
	
	Changes are not submitted until the participant "presses the submit button".
	On submit, if any validation rule fail, submission fails and the participant is alerted and given a chance to make corrections.
	
	In the meanwhile, someone else may also be editing the same element. When that happens, the participant is notified (visual cue?) about it and can
	access the list of these other participants. 

	If none of the participant is authoritative, then all participants can make modifications at once with the same effect as if they were doing it sequentially.

	If at least one of the participant has authority over the element, then the other participants are appropriately alerted  (visual cue?) since this participant's
	edits may override the other participants' edits. When a participant hits the "reset" button, the editor is refreshed to reflect the current state of the element,
	taking into account the latest submitted edits.
	
	Each property is restricted as to what kinds of values it can have. 
	The user either enters the value by hand or selects it using some UI device (calendar for date, slider for numerical value, type tree for types, a modal editor for "complex" values etc.)
	The changes to property values are validated.

**** Authority vs opinions
	
	The participant can edit an element either with or without authority.

	The system determines whether the user has authority over an element (e.g. a participant has authority over his/her own profile).

	Often, when a participant adds a new element, he/she automatically acquires authority over it for as long as he/she retains the privileges that allowed this addition.

	More than one user can have authority over an element (e.g. a participant, his/her organizational representative and the project's manager).
	
	<An element without authoritative user other than a project manager is said to be "public".>
	
	When a non-authoritative participant sets or changes the value of an element's property, this it is considered an opinion and it is recorded with other opinions.

	When an authoritative participant sets or changes the value of an element's property, it overrides all and any opinions, or any previous authoritative value, and becomes the effective value.
	In the absence of an authoritative property value, the majority opinion is the effective value. In case of a tie, the oldest of the tied opinions wins.
	
	The opinions and authoritative values are available for perusal. All opinions, their counts and their contributors can be viewed.
	A participant can readily see his/her contribution to an element's property value and whether it differs from the effective value.
	
*** {Accept or reject a suggested element}

	The system can infer new elements (issues, todos, exchanges etc.) on the basis of existing elements.
	When it does, the systems can add them tentatively as suggestions to be accepted or rejected.
	Note that the system may later retract the element if the conditions that lead to its inference are no longer present.
	
	<What happens then to participant-added elements that refer to a retracted element?>
	
	A participant with access to a suggested element can reject or accept it.
	The participant can be authoritative or not. If not, then the participant expresses an opinion as to the validity of the suggestion. Opinions are cumulated and the
	prevailing yeah/neah vote is the effective. If an authoritative participant accepts or rejects it, then it is so.
	
	Rejected, suggested elements are accessible and visible to participants (with visual cue?) so that they can weigh in (opinions) or decree (authoritative) otherwise.

** {Open analytical view}

	The participant has a choice of a number of analytical views. The participant can:
	
	* {{{#open_a_causal_graph} Open a causal graph}}
	
	* {{{#open_a_flow_graph} Open a flow graph}}
	
	* {{{#open_a_semantic_graph} Open a semantic graph}}
	
	[]

*** {Open a causal graph}

	The participant selects a scenario or an event and requests a causal graph.

	The causal graph shows the scenario's incidents or the selected event connected to all events that cause it or are caused by it.

	The participant can select an event and expand it to reveal its caused/causing events that are not yet showing.

	The participant can select an event and collapse it, hiding its caused/causing events that are showing.

** {Manage archives}

	TBD

** {Invite user}

	A participant, i.e. a certified member of an organization, can make it easy for someone from the same organization to join in.
	
	The participant requests the registration of a new user.

	The participant fills out the user registration form on behalf of user, including name but <<not>> email address.

	The participant selects an organization he/she is a certified member of and certifies that the new user is a member of it as well. 

	The participant then becomes the new user's mentor.

	The participant may indentify and describe the roles the new user plays within the organization (the goal being to minimize data entry for the new user).

	The participant then sends the invitation (here the email address is entered but is not retained) which will be received as an email 
	with a link for the new user to access to confirm acceptance of the invitation.
	
	The organization's representative will receive a notification and may decide to cancel the certification.

	<The representative either authorizes the certification before or after it is sent out (a user setting for the representative).>
