	[]

	A Channels administrator is the gate keeper for new projects and is the ultimate authority for a Channels installation.

	Channels gives a project manager the necessary privileges to act as a "benevolent dictator" who sets the direction and scope of a project without having to micro-manage it.

	Channels gives the representative of an organization the rights to control how the organization is described across projects and to certify users role-playing members of the organization.

	Channels empowers participants to create scenarios, to view all project content, to authoritatively edit "their" content and to enter opinions as to the rest.

** {Request user status}

	Someone without user status accesses a Channels site. A login form appears offering the option to register as a new user.
	The user selects this option and is shown a form where personal info is requested (could be simply name and email).
	The user also completes a captchas test (transcribes a visually encoded message).
	The user is then sent an email with a link to follow in order to complete registration.
	
** {Request certification}

	The user requests to be certificed as a member of a given organization.
	The user selects an organization from a directory of all organizations represented in a Channels installation (i.e. that have representatives).
	The user may specify one or more role types (from typology of roles or by naming them if not available). 
	The user then requests to be certified by the organization's representative (or participant if representative allows) as member as playing the given roles.
	
	A representative of the organization receives and processes the request and may further describe the role(s).
	
	The user is notified when certification is obtained. The user can then browse all projects in which he/she is now
	participant or guest by virtue of certified membership in the organization.
	
** {Accept invitation}

	Someone receives an email from a Channels participant inviting him/her to join a project.
	The participant has already certified the user as a co-member of an organization.
	The new user clicks on a link in the email which takes the user to a form where he/she is asked to enter and confirm a password.
	The new user is then shown a startup desktop.
	
** {Login}

	The user points a browser to the Channel installation's URL. A login form appears. 
	The user enters user id and password, and submits.
	
	If the user forgot his/her password, the user clicks on a link that emails a new, one time password.
	
	If the user logs in with a one-time password, after successfully logging in, the user is asked to {{{change_password} change the one-time password}}.
	If the user fails to obtain a new password (user cancelled), the participant is logged out and retains the old one-time password.
	
	If the user logs in successfully, the user acquires all project and application privileges. The Channels "desktop" last saved for this user appears (or else the default desktop). 
	The users leaves the desktop after {{{logout}logging out}}.
	
** {Logout}

	The user requests to log out. A modal dialog requests confirmation. 
	The user is given the option to "save the desktop" (default option).
	The user either confirms or cancels the logout.
	
** {Change password}

	The user is presented with a Change Password modal dialog containing instructions about devising secure passwords.
	The user enters a new password twice.
	
	The password is checked to see if it is secure. If not, the user is told why and asked to try again.
	The user can cancel the operation.
	
** {Update user information}

	When registering as a Channels user (by initiating a request or by accepting an invitation), the user provides basic user information and in return is given a user id and a (one-time) password.
	It is the user's responsibility to maintain and update this information.
	
	The user can:
	
	* Update his/her name
	
	* Update his/her email address
