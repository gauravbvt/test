Judy get’s these two grants on her desk and says: they seem connected to me, is anyone talking about it? I do not blame the POs at all. They are just tracking down what they have to do and have no idea of the details of each other’s work.\"\n\n\"One of the challenges that Heather and I have is we will see a grant and a few weeks later we will see another one. I am thinking that maybe a few times a year we’ll meet spend a day where people will come and say: these are the next five grants I am making, and share it, and then people make connections or VPs make connections; it becomes a learning training opportunity.\"','',NULL,37,NULL),(137,14,'Describing a Program Officer call center, Zia said it would provide Program Officers with the following types of information: \n\n\"• One call center aspect would be easy, effortless capture. After a trip they would have one number to call – right now they have to write up a trip report -- and over the phone they could say: I met so and so, these were the problems and interesting ideas. The call center agent knows what questions to ask. \n• The second is proactive information seeking. I am going to Rio, I am working on this urban infrastructure thing, and I need to know everything we’ve done on financing and infrastructure, activity in Latin America, a few segments, prioritized. They kind of know what they are looking for.\n• The third, and most difficult, is when they don\'t know what to ask for because they just don\'t know. And so, what’s the “radio broadcast” or “newspaper” that comes out about interesting things\"\n\n\"In my old firm, we had knowledge specialists that played that role.
