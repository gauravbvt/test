INSERT INTO `approach` VALUES (1,'KM Analyst ','',NULL,34),(2,'Terminology Management/RF Data Strategy','Terminology Management will contribute to consistency in the usage of terms that are central to the management of the Foundation and the development of KM systems and processes.  This approach will be the basis for the use of the metadata needed in other KM Approaches and allow for the creation of taxonomies around the work of the Rockefeller Foundation.  A complementary data strategy enables the KM PO to more easily capture, store, and access grant- and initiative-related information and knowledge.',NULL,2),(3,'Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and Search','A system allowing for the management of, and permissioned search of, all content in the organization will be put in place.   ECM and Search allow for categorization, tagging, filtering of readily accessible databases, as well as notification subscriptions designed to enable the right people to quickly and efficiently find the right answers and information.',NULL,36),(4,'Decision Support Documents (DSDs)','These documents serve as templates for creating intelligence for decision makers. DSDs will be created in various areas of RF’s work, and in particular for critical decisions in the Initiative Model. Because they specify information requirements and sources of critically needed information, DSDs guide knowledge sharing.  DSDs should be stored in a searchable, easily accessible repository, and wiki articles should link to them.',NULL,64),(5,'Initiative Model Protocols (IMPs)','IMPs translate the Initiative Model into more actionable guidance and serve as job aids for the roles involved. IMPs will clarify the interdependencies between the elements in the Initiative Model such as roles, decisions, documents, and meetings, and specify the IT systems where the information is meant to be accessed or stored.',NULL,51),(6,'KM Training and Learning Curriculum','Through this curriculum the  KM skills of RF employees will be developed to ensure that staff members learn how to integrate KM successfully into their work and improve their job performance.  The KM Program Office will work with HR to design and develop training and learning courses on topics such as Grant-making and Grant Management; Resilience and Equitable Growth; Introduction to the Initiative Model; Understanding RF’s Current Initiatives; Strategies for Innovation, Influence, and Intervention; and KM for Managers.',NULL,34),(7,'Cross Initiative Horizontal Fusion Meeting','A quarterly meeting/workshop will be held to surface connection points between initiatives and foster cross-initiative learning and knowledge sharing. Foundation Initiative (FI) teams are often unaware of endeavors their peers are involved in that may be related to their own and consequently, opportunities to collaborate and better design initiatives have been missed.  This quarterly meeting will enable greater awareness of FI teams with regard to other interventions RF is pursuing, allow for the transfer of best practices and lessons learned, and also enhance the teams’ overall knowledge of the field.',NULL,2),(8,'KM Support to Strategic Foundation Communications','To support strategic communications, the KM Program Office will work with the President’s Office and Communications Team to define the inputs needed for communications activities, including briefings, media opportunities, and requests for reports, speeches, articles, etc. The KM Approach Team will design protocols and mechanisms for gathering this information and making it more readily accessible.',NULL,36),(9,'Strategic Portfolio Management (SPM)','A portfolio of initiative options and tailored intelligence products will be created and maintained.  SPM will  allow RF management to get the support they need to decide how best to intervene to aid the poor and vulnerable. Currently, RF management is not given a portfolio of comparable initiatives with information on costs, potential impact, risks, and strategic value, and executives are overloaded with documents that do not deliver the tailored intelligence they need.  The SPM approach will ensure management is provided with intelligence tailored to their individual decision making needs, create a portfolio of comparable initiative options strengthening their ability to compare and prioritize among a broad range of intervention opportunities. This KM Approach Team will design a Strategic Initiatives Dashboard providing situational awareness on the status of initiatives.',NULL,64),(10,'Initiative KM & Communication Plans ','',NULL,51),(11,'Knowledge Fusion Center (KFC)','The KFC will deliver knowledge and information services for the Executive Team, Initiative Teams, Communications Department, Grantees and Partners, and the Public. KFC’s “call center” will be the go-to source for any information RF staff needs surrounding events, convenings, people, organizations, upcoming trips, trending issues related to their initiative, problem spaces, and opportunities. RF staff will also have access to multimedia tools that allow drill-down from a macro overview at the initiative level, to a 360-degree micro view of people, events, organizations, convenings, reports related to initiatives, and specific grants in Scan, Search, Development and Execution.

RF staff will have a quick, easy, and interactive way to get information on fundamental questions about the organization and the initiative model including IT usage guides, financials guides, RF Strategy, etc.  Best practices and lessons learned will be recorded and shared, and staff will be able to author entries on topics of interest.

The answers in the FAQ system indicate what information is needed to answer the questions and where that information is supposed to be stored, with links if possible.',NULL,2),(22,'Critical SSDE Knowledge Audit','The RF KM program aims to map and understand the processes and critical flows of knowledge, information, and data needed to implement the Initiative Model. The audit will look at topics such as the knowledge needs of SSDE participants; where the knowledge assets and resources are in the Foundation; existing gaps in knowledge; how knowledge flows and needs to flow around the organization and what blockages exist to that flow; and to what extent people, processes, and technology support or hamper the effective flow of knowledge.  Following the audit, the KM Program Office will analyze and develop a strategy that includes how to collect, analyze, disseminate, store, and archive the Foundation’s critical knowledge.',NULL,36),(23,'Global Engagement Network Platform','The Global Engagement Network, powered by the MindPeer platform, will enable the Foundation and its partners to create public or private networks (on a per-initiative, per–topic, or general basis) whose members publish and subscribe to commentary and questions from experts and peers in real-time. The system will enable groups to efficiently analyze and synthesize information.',NULL,64),(24,'KM and Communications Support to Initiatives','The KM Program Office and communications team will develop a planning framework that initiatives will use to define knowledge development, communication, dissemination, and outreach activities throughout initiative model / grant lifecycles. This will maximize the potential knowledge creation, sharing, and relationship-building.',NULL,51),(25,'Rocklink UX Redesign','A redesign of Rocklink will be undertaken to enable better search and content sharingbetween RF staff.  This includes enhancing Rocklink’s utility as a document repository and KM system that systematically captures and manages information for the grant-making process.  The Rocklink site experience will be  better focused and prioritized utilizing a design that  facilitates finding content and efficient site use. ',NULL,34);
